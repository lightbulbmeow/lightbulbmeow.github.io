        <h1>Entry #2</h1>

        <p class="date">July 4, 2023. 4:30pm</p>

        <p>Second entry! It's been a while since I last updated my website. I have lots of things I want to do and I can't decide on which one I should do first!  (>_<;)</p>

        <p>To name a few,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to learn Godot once and for all. It feels intimidating to learn at first but I'd imagine I'll quickly get used to it. Perhaps I just need a small push to get me to started.</li>
            <li>I want to relearn JavaScript. I already know how to use it before, but I forgot most of it now (ーωー;). This would be very useful if I want to automate stuff in my website.
            <li>I want to learn more math. Math is fun! I have a <b>ton</b> of math books in my backlog, currently juggling between reading all of them. The main one I'm focusing on right now is <i>Measure, Integration & Real Analysis</i> by Sheldon Axler (<a href="https://measure.axler.net">link</a>). I currently know nothing about measure theory, but I like real analysis (a bit) so this might be interesting.</li>
            <li>I think I should finish the osu!taiko map I've been working on. It's almost done, just need to map out a single section remaining.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I guess those are the ones on the top of my to-do list at least.</p>

        <p>I'd also like to improve the website more, but I don't really know what else to add. Maybe I'll upload whatever games and projects I make here when I create them.</p>

        <p>Recently, I also learned how to make AI art! It's really easy, all you have to do is download AUTOMATIC1111 and there. It's entirely open-sourced too and even works offline (only downside is it requires like 20GB <img src="nanasmirk.webp" width=24 />). The first image I generated was Niko. I thought it was good so I upscaled it and made it my Discord profile pic.</p>

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="ai-art-000.png" width="25%" /> <img src="ai-art-001.jpeg" width="33%" />
        </div>

        <p>I also tested the img2img feature by drawing Miku in Niko's clothes using Paint and gave it to the AI. I think the result is really cute!</p>

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="ai-art-003.png" width="25%" /> <img src="ai-art-004.png" width="25%" />
        </div>

        <p>It makes me wonder whether the same thing exists for AI chatbots, since they <i>should</i> be a lot simpler than generating images right? Problem is I can't find any good open-source/offline alternative.</p>

        <p>The most popular choice seems to be using OpenAI's API, but I don't really find it reliable. First, the AI lacks any freedom, it keeps saying something like "I can't form opinions" or "Sorry, I cannot act like a tsundere as it is against OpenAI's guidelines". Second, I don't trust the API being free forever. I want an open-source offline alternative which would give me more freedom over what the AI could do, so that's something also in my to-do list.</p>

        <h1>Entry #1</h1>

        <p class="date">June 25, 2023. 8:25pm</p>

        <p>Hello! Welcome to my... erm... empty blog (for now). <img src="koishibaka.png" width=24 /></p>

        <p>I actually have <i>two other</i> blogs. One on <a href="https://lightbulbmeow.wordpress.com">WordPress</a> (I think I never made it public), and another on <a href="https://lightbulbmeow.blogspot.com">Blogger</a> (which is also just dead). I wanted more freedom over my content, so I decided to <s>make my life harder</s> code up an entire website from scratch. Yes, I am typing <b>everything</b> in this website manually.</p>

        <p>I'm still deciding how I want my blog to look like, while trying to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I should try coding up something to make blog entry writing easier for me. Maybe I'll try to store all my blog entries as markdown files, then use JavaScript to automate it into HTML code.</p>

        <p>I should also try making $\LaTeX$ work somehow, because I want to write math stuffs too. (<b>Update</b>: I made it work! It's super easy. (<span style="transform: rotate(90deg); display: inline-block;">:P</span>) )</p>

        $$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac1{n^2}=\frac{\pi^2}6$$

        <p>I should also make it so that I can type Discord emojis, like <span class="code">:niko:</span> automatically turns into <img src="niko.png" width=24 /></p>

        <p>I think those are the only features I need for now... (I just hope this blog doesn't end up as another abandoned project. <img src="nanacry.webp" width=24 />)</p>
