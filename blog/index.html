        <h1>CCBC 16 Reflection</h1>

        I tried the <a href="https://ccbc16.cipherpuzzles.com">16th CCBC hunt</a>... solo... without knowing any Chinese. :mikuhehe: I thought it would be a nice challenge. After all, I managed to finish three puzzle hunts solo before: <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com">Teammate Hunt</a>, <a href="https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com">Brown Puzzlehunt</a> and <a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/">Silph Puzzlehunt</a>.<br/><br/>

        This was not the first time I've participated in a Chinese hunt. I solved the <a href="https://ccbc15.cipherpuzzles.com">15th CCBC</a> with a team of members who knew some Chinese, and we finished it. Unfortunately, time drifts us apart, and my old team is busy with real life things. So this year, I only have myself going in CCBC. It was also the reason why I started doing puzzlehunts solo. :pomicry:<br/><br/>

        When the hunt was about to start, I was excited and a bit nervous at the same time. I wonder how difficult it would be? I know I struggled with some Chinese puzzles before because I was Chinese-language-blocked. Throughout the hunt, ChatGPT and Gemini were my best friends; they know a lot more Chinese than me, that's for sure. (According to the rules, using AI is allowed! :nanasmirk:)<br/><br/>

        <h1>More blog updates!</h1>

        <p class="date">July 19, 2024. 6:50pm</p>

        <p>Hello! Thank you for reading this, whoever you are :bebelove: I'm glad you find my website interesting. I don't really have much to say right now. Recently I've been playing a bunch of new games, like Blue Archive, Risk of Rain 2, and I Wanna Lockpick. Really fun games.</p>

        <p>A ton of inspiration came to me over the past three months, which gave me lots of motivation to continue working on this website! I added lots of new content:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Added a bunch of silly new stuff to my homepage, just to make it a bit livelier. :nanaxd: Now there's a cute little cat chasing around your cursor at the homepage. It's still not very wacky enough compared to those websites at Neocities.</li>
            <li>I added a new <a href="../art/index.html">art section</a> to my website. There, I uploaded all the drawings I've made! Please check them out, and I hope you like them. :bebelove: I want to be good at drawing someday...</li>
            <li>I wrote a couple new posts on my <a href="../math/index.html">math blog</a>. For some reason I just felt like writing some math exposition. Two of them are computer-sciencey, so I figured out a way to make codeblocks look pretty in HTML. I settled on using <a href="https://pygments.org">Pygments</a>, a thing that lets you convert Python into nice-looking HTML code. As of now, the process is kinda clunky because I have to manually run the script every time I place a new codeblock. One day I should figure out how to automate all these processes when making a blog post... :menherateehee:</li>
            <li>I added a new <a href="../puzzles/index.html">puzzles section</a>, because I like puzzles! I plan to make a bunch of puzzles in the future, whenever inspiration comes. Right now, there's only a few of them. :heh:</li>
            <li><a href="../cute/index.html">Cute pictures</a>!!! I've been putting this off of a long time. The thing that finally motivated me to finish up this webpage is this <i><a href="https://x.com/_ar0n0429/status/1418531320225955852">super cute image</a> of Nanahira and Choko</i>! AAAAA<b>AAAAAA<i>AAAAA!!!!!</i></b> :nanaaaa::nanaaaa::nanaaaa:
        </ul>

        <p>I guess that's all. Once again, thank you for sticking around! :bebelove: It means a lot to me.</p>

        <h1>An update, after six months</h1>

        <p class="date">April 15, 2024. 9:20am</p>

        <p>Six months since I last updated my blog... :tere: I lot of things have happened in my life during those times, lots of ups and downs. A certain friend helped me give the motivation to continue working on this website again. For the past month, I've added a lot of new things!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First, I added a <a href="../nanahira/nanahira.html">Nanahira shrine</a>. This was heavily inspired by <a href="https://anime.coffee/nanahira">some other person's Nanahira shrine.</a> When I saw that website, it just gave me a sudden urge to make my own too. I went back relearn all the stuff I used to do when making a website: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. He helped improve mine, and in turn, I helped improve his website too.</li>
            <li>Next, I organized all the webpages into folders, and added new sections in the homepage. I have lots of new ideas for the website. Games, web apps, my art, a gallery of cute pictures! :nanakiss:</li>
            <li>I've taken an interest with working on "web apps". They aren't really that fancy or anything; they're more like just small scripts that I find to be really convenient to have a webpage of. For a long time, I've always wanted to give my scripts some sort of UI, and JavaScript turned out to be just the thing I needed all this time!</li>
            <li>Among the ones I did was the <a href="../apps/imageeditor/index.html">JavaScript Image Editor</a>. It helped me quickly edit images using script, anywhere I want! :chokodestroy: Programming it was also a challenge; I had to relearn how to work with canvases and handle file uploading.</li>
            <li>Another one I did was the <a href="../apps/darklightmode/index.html">Dark/Light Mode Image Generator.</a> Not really particularly useful or anything, it's more of just a silly one-off thing I wanted to pull off. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrNT4A1_Mjo">It's not an original idea of mine</a>; I just wanted to see if I could make it happen myself too.</li>
            <li>Finally, I decided to start a <a href="../math/index.html">math blog.</a> When a friend of mine showed me a blog post about some logic puzzle, it gave me a perfect idea of what to add in my math blog. I had <i>too</i> much stuff to say about it... it ended up being a 4-parter! I should learn how to make shorter posts next time... :heh:
        </ul>

        <p>For a long time, I haven't made a single update to this website because... it felt like there was no point. I kept asking myself, "what's the point of doing it, if nobody sees it anyways?" It felt as if all my efforts are for nothing, until recently I guess.</p>

        <p>I'm very thankful to that friend who continued to support me throughout these months. It gave me the motivation to improve further. I guess... as long as I know that there's at least one person who appreciates what I'm doing, I think that's enough motivation for me to keep going. :bebelove:</p>

        <h1>300 Level Game</h1>

        <p class="date">October 7, 2023. 3:35pm</p>

        <p>Ah. It's been three months since I last updated my blog... (I haven't really had much motivation to post in here recently.) :zonepeek:</p>

        <p>In the past weeks, I've been learning how to use Godot. I made my first game! It's called "300 Level Game", and I posted the game on <a href="https://lightbulbmeow.itch.io/300-level-game">itch.io</a> so please check it out!</p>

        <center>
            <img src="level-game-1.png" width="33%"/>
        </center>

        <p>The game is heavily inspired by <a href="https://levelgame.net">Never Ending Level Game</a>, a Flash game where you basically try to figure out how to get to the next level. Some levels would require you to press a button, or guess the password, or solve some puzzle, etc. I don't know if the game is still playable nowadays, given that Flash no longer exists. :kanadecry:</p>

        <p>The last time I ever made a game was, I think, 12 years ago? That was when Flash still existed, and then I never touched it again ever since. Now, I'm relearning how to make games again, through Godot! It feels like I want to be a game developer again after all those years...</p>

        <p>As of now, my game only has 20 levels, and I hope to reach my goal of 300 levels. I did this since I thought it would be fun to create whatever, experimenting with stuff I can do in Godot and an idea dump about what kind of games I could make.</p>

        <p>I learned a lot about Godot ever since I made this game. (I guess all those years of programming weren't a total waste after all?) Maybe in the future I could try touching some of the more advanced stuff in Godot, such as, <b>3D</b> <i>*gasp*</i></p>

        <p>Oh, I should also release a hint guide for my game soon.</p>

        <h1>New 'Paint' program I made in Pygame</h1>

        <p class="date">July 22, 2023. 3:40pm</p>

        <p>It's been two weeks since I last touched this website :zonepeek:</p>

        <p>I've been working on a 'paint' program for my own personal use. I want a paint program that allows me lots of flexibility and precision. Something that allows me to use code for image manipulation on the fly, and something that allows me to do drawing through scripting.</p>

        <p>I really wanted to use Python for this since it has lots of convenient modules, so I settled on using Pygame. This is <i>probably</i> not the best engine to use... (⌒_⌒;) It's just the one I'm most familiar with. The main library I use for image manipulation is PIL.</p>

        <p>Here is what it looks like right now, there's not much:</p>

        <center>
            <a href="paint.html"><img src="paint/paint-1.png" width="50%"/></a>

        <h1>Entry #2</h1>

        <p class="date">July 4, 2023. 4:30pm</p>

        <p>Second entry! It's been a while since I last updated my website. I have lots of things I want to do and I can't decide on which one I should do first!  (>_<;)</p>

        <p>To name a few,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to learn Godot once and for all. It feels intimidating to learn at first but I'd imagine I'll quickly get used to it. Perhaps I just need a small push to get me to started.</li>
            <li>I want to relearn JavaScript. I already know how to use it before, but I forgot most of it now (ーωー;). This would be very useful if I want to automate stuff in my website.
            <li>I want to learn more math. Math is fun! I have a <b>ton</b> of math books in my backlog, currently juggling between reading all of them. The main one I'm focusing on right now is <i>Measure, Integration & Real Analysis</i> by Sheldon Axler (<a href="https://measure.axler.net">link</a>). I currently know nothing about measure theory, but I like real analysis (a bit) so this might be interesting.</li>
            <li>I think I should finish the osu!taiko map I've been working on. It's almost done, just need to map out a single section remaining.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I guess those are the ones on the top of my to-do list at least.</p>

        <p>I'd also like to improve the website more, but I don't really know what else to add. Maybe I'll upload whatever games and projects I make here when I create them.</p>

        <p>Recently, I also learned how to make AI art! It's really easy, all you have to do is download AUTOMATIC1111 and there. It's entirely open-sourced too and even works offline (only downside is it requires like 20GB :nanasmirk:). The first image I generated was Niko. I thought it was good so I upscaled it and made it my Discord profile pic.</p>

        <center>
            <img src="ai-art-000.png" width="25%" /> <img src="ai-art-001.jpeg" width="33%" />
        </center>

        <p>I also tested the img2img feature by drawing Miku in Niko's clothes using Paint and gave it to the AI. I think the result is really cute!</p>

        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="ai-art-003.png" width="25%" /> <img src="ai-art-004.png" width="25%" />
        </div>

        <p>It makes me wonder whether the same thing exists for AI chatbots, since they <i>should</i> be a lot simpler than generating images right? Problem is I can't find any good open-source/offline alternative.</p>

        <p>The most popular choice seems to be using OpenAI's API, but I don't really find it reliable. First, the AI lacks any freedom, it keeps saying something like "I can't form opinions" or "Sorry, I cannot act like a tsundere as it is against OpenAI's guidelines". Second, I don't trust the API being free forever. I want an open-source offline alternative which would give me more freedom over what the AI could do, so that's something also in my to-do list.</p>

        <h1>Entry #1</h1>

        <p class="date">June 25, 2023. 8:25pm</p>

        <p>Hello! Welcome to my... erm... empty blog (for now). :koishibaka:</p>

        <p>I actually have <i>two other</i> blogs. One on <a href="https://lightbulbmeow.wordpress.com">WordPress</a> (I think I never made it public), and another on <a href="https://lightbulbmeow.blogspot.com">Blogger</a> (which is also just dead). I wanted more freedom over my content, so I decided to <s>make my life harder</s> code up an entire website from scratch. Yes, I am typing <b>everything</b> in this website manually.</p>

        <p>I'm still deciding how I want my blog to look like, while trying to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I should try coding up something to make blog entry writing easier for me. Maybe I'll try to store all my blog entries as markdown files, then use JavaScript to automate it into HTML code.</p>

        <p>I should also try making $\LaTeX$ work somehow, because I want to write math stuffs too. (<b>Update</b>: I made it work! It's super easy. (<span style="transform: rotate(90deg); display: inline-block;">:P</span>) )</p>

        $$\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac1{n^2}=\frac{\pi^2}6$$

        <p>I should also make it so that I can type Discord emojis, like <span class="code">:ni<!-- Hahaha, I implemented it now! -->ko:</span> automatically turns into :niko:</p>

        <p>I think those are the only features I need for now... (I just hope this blog doesn't end up as another abandoned project. :nanacry:)</p>
