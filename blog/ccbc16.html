        <h1>CCBC 16 Reflection</h1>

        <p class="date">August 17, 2025. 10:00pm</p>

            <a href="https://ccbc16.cipherpuzzles.com"><img src="ccbc16.png" /></a>
        </center><br/>

        I tried the <a href="https://ccbc16.cipherpuzzles.com">16th CCBC hunt</a>... solo... without knowing any Chinese. :mikuhehe: I thought it would be a nice challenge. After all, I managed to finish three puzzle hunts solo before: <a href="https://2025.teammatehunt.com">Teammate Hunt</a>, <a href="https://www.brownpuzzlehunt.com">Brown Puzzlehunt</a> and <a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/">Silph Puzzlehunt</a>.<br/><br/>

        This was not the first time I've participated in a Chinese hunt. I solved the <a href="https://ccbc15.cipherpuzzles.com">15th CCBC</a> with a team of members who knew some Chinese, and we finished it. Unfortunately, time drifts us apart, and my old team is busy with real life things. So this year, I only have myself going in CCBC. It was also the reason why I started doing puzzlehunts solo. :pomicry:<br/><br/>

        When the hunt was about to start, I was excited and a bit nervous at the same time. I wonder how difficult it would be? I know I struggled with some Chinese puzzles before because I was Chinese-language-blocked. Throughout the hunt, ChatGPT and Gemini were my best friends; they know a lot more Chinese than me, that's for sure. (According to the rules, using AI is allowed! :nanasmirk:)<br/><br/>

        <h2>Hunt start</h2>
        The hunt has started and I was greeted with 4 puzzles.  Lots of them are easy, as expected of round 1.<br/><br/>

        A few of these puzzles have been made trivial by ChatGPT, such as 小题大做 and 五音俱全. Some did not require any Chinese knowledge and have a cute "aha" moment, like 通用机器人 and 恶魔斯基.<br/><br/>

        Other ones I struggled with a bit, like 相辅相成 and 数字, since I was not a Chinese speaker. For 相辅相成, <a href="https://chengyu.qianp.com">chengyu.qianp.com</a> carried me real hard, it specializes in Chinese idioms. For 数字, I had pray to Google and Baidu to give me the correct search results.<br/><br/>

        The ones I haven't solved are 四方谜, 当立, and 霓虹七色. 四方谜 seems tedious, having to scour through all the solution pages. 当立 is a Chinese dropquote, just straight up impossible for a non-Chinese speaker. 霓虹七色 had a hint saying "just search the terms together" yet it yielded no result on Google or <a href="https://www.baidu.com">Baidu</a>.<br/><br/>

        I should probably also mention that I was <i>very</i> liberal with using hints this hunt compared to usual, since from past experience in Chinese hunts, we always ended up having wayyy more credits than needed by the end of the hunt. :tere:<br/><br/>

        Here are some puzzles that stood out to me:<br/>

        <h3>一笔画: A single stroke</h3>
        This was the first puzzle in the hunt. As soon as I opened the puzzle, I instantly recognized what to do. These are all Chinese characters as if they were written with a single stroke! I tried out the puzzle for quite a while, struggling to figure out the Chinese characters they're trying to draw. <a href="https://qhanzi.com">Qhazi.com</a> carried me a lot here. I also had my cousin (who apparently had a tiny bit of Chinese writing experience) help me with some of the simpler Chinese characters.<br/><br/>

        <center>
            <img src="ccbc16_qhanzi.png" width="25%" />
        </center><br/>

        I experimented with different combinations of Chinese characters, entering partial phrases to ChatGPT or Gemini until something coherent came up. After lots of trials and tribulations, Gemini came up with "末句六字" for the third line, and "秋收起义" for the second line. Some Google told me the poem I needed was "西江月·秋收起义", so I submitted the final line of the poem, and it was correct.<br/>

        <h3>举🚩不定: Uncertain minesweeper</h3>
        This one is very cute and does something I've never seen in other logic puzzles before. It intentionally uses non-uniqueness to extract the answer!<br/>

        <h3>META: 星之所在</h3>
        This meta I pretty much solved quickly without any hints. My instinct was to look for star-related things, so the first thing I did here was dump the feeders to Deepseek and ask if they were related to stars. Deepseek made some connections, with SAVIOR almost looking like SIRIUS, a star, or MIMOSA PUDICA containing a star name MIMOSA, and so on. That second observation cracked the puzzle open for me.<br/><br/>

        <h2>A new teammate!</h2>
        Sometime during round 1, I was about to give up on CCBC hunt. When I was still stuck on round 1, the only unsolved puzzles I had unlocked at the time are 四方谜, 数字, 当立, and 霓虹七色, all of which seems heavily reliant on Chinese knowledge.<br/><br/>

        四方谜 was about a previous hunt, and I didn't feel like slogging through all the solution pages.<br/>
        数字 references a bunch of Chinese poems, and my first attempt at Googling them didn't yield any good results.<br/>
        当立 is a Chinese dropquote, one big "nope" for me.<br/>
        霓虹七色 had a hint which didn't work for me no matter how I tried.<br/><br/>

        At this point I kinda lost motivation and was about to give up. :zonesad: But then a friend of mine messaged me. He asked me "How was CCBC?"<br/><br/>

        Then he offered to help me with some puzzles, this was the motivation that kept me going through the hunt. I decided to pick up the easiest looking puzzle I have, 数字, and tried actually brute forcing through the Google results. I finally succeeded this time.<br/><br/>

        It turns out, I was just one solve away from the meta! I unlocked the meta, which was pretty easy, and finally unlocked round 2.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Round 2</h2>
        This is where the real hunt begins.<br/><br/>

        Our unsolved puzzles are 浮想联翩, 周而复始, and 笑点解析.<br/><br/>

        For 浮想联翩, my friend worked on it, but unfortunately got stuck due to the language barrier.<br/>
        For 周而复始, we're very close to solving it, but we couldn't execute the final step. We ended up backsolving that one.<br/>
        笑点解析 is apparently about "Soviet jokes". It also has the highest solve rate in this round, we have no idea why. :nanathink:<br/><br/>

        Most of the puzzles in this round are pretty memorable:<br/>

        <h3>●■★▲</h3>
        Funny idea. I've never seen a meta where all the feeders don't have any letters!<br/><br/>

        I must admit, we didn't properly solve this puzzle, but we were close. The final cluephrase we got was something like
        $$\frac{\text{circle area}}{r\text{ squared}}[\text{8th star number}\cdots]$$
        which probably simplifies to $337\pi$, but it didn't extract to anything nice. We blindly guessed the correct answer, BERMUDA, because... it's related to triangles I guess. :menherateehee:

        <h3>三星Galaxy: Samsung Galaxy</h3>
        Fun logic puzzle. The Penpa controls for this one are a bit awkward, so I did this entirely in Paint. The extraction part is pretty funny, my friend helped me with this one. Who would expect there to be <i>Korean</i> in a <i>Chinese</i> puzzlehunt?

        <center>
            <img src="ccbc16_galaxy.png" width="25%" />
        </center><br/>

        <h3>你想Roll出怎样的比赛: What game do you roll?</h3>
        This one is really nice. The story is small enough that mapping out the entire thing is not too tedious. I also used <span class="code">graphviz</span> to create a pretty diagram for this puzzle.<br/><br/>

        <center>
            <img src="ccbc16_roll.png" width="33%" />
        </center><br/>

        Then I had an idea to figure out the probabilities of getting each ending. I did this in a very lazy way: I encoded the Markov chain as a matrix $M$, then just raised the matrix to the power of 1000, hoping that the values of $M^n$ quickly converge to something nice.<br/>

        <h3>Link It All</h3>
        This was a nightmare. All the questions are written in Chinese, and even worse, all the answers are in Chinese too! :kanadecry:<br/><br/>

        When I pasted all the questions to Gemini, it easily figured out the puzzle was about Breath of the Wild, so that was a good start. But then the answers its giving have wrong enumerations, so I had to consult the other AIs, ChatGPT, Deepseek, and Grok!<br/><br/>

        Even then, some of their answers don't fit the enumeration, and the answers they give are inconsistent! :mikuangery: Because of this, I decided to tabulate <i>all</i> the response of the four different AI, and chose the answer which the majority of them gave. This method was still only able to give answers to half of the questions, so I decided to just wing it and do the final step anyways. It was a headache to solve this puzzle, and I'm surprised I was even able to frontsolve this at all.<br/>

        <h3>就是为了这点醋: Just for this little bit of vinegar</h3>
        Fun little minimeta. Surprisingly, it doesnt require that much Chinese knowledge. Each subpuzzle here only relies on Chinese character components, or its pinyin, which are pretty easy to work with even for non-Chinese speakers. I did struggle with the last step though, trying to find words that end in 子. I had to custom hint that one, but in hindsight I could have solved it easily by just looking them up in <a href="https://baike.baidu.com">Baidu Baike</a>, the Chinese version of Wikipedia.

        <h3>复习资料: Review Materials</h3>
        Nice concept, but unfortunately gets tedious pretty quickly. I just wrote Python code to automate most of the process for me; I had to solve up to 120 to figure out the pattern.<br/><br/>

        English is trivial.<br/>
        For Math, I used sympy's <span class="code">factorint</span>.<br/>
        For Chemistry, at first I just relied on Gemini to just give me the codons for each RNA sequence. Eventually, I automated this in Python by coding up all the codons, with help from Gemini to compile the codon table for me.<br/>
        For Chinese, at first I relied on ChatGPT to give me the pinyins. But it was pretty slow and eventually I ran out of free credits, so I found the <span class="code">pinyin</span> module and used that instead.<br/>
        For Physics, I just memorized most of the formulas since they eventually repeat, and WOFed the ones I don't know.<br/>

        <h3>高楼大厦</h3>
        Nice simple logic puzzle. The idea is that you're given an isometric view of some skyscrapers, and your goal is to reconstruct the actual thing. I'm really bad at visualizing 3D, so I booted up Minecraft to help me visualize the skyscrapers. I used different colored wool for different skyscraper heights, in order to easily distinguish them for extraction.<br/><br/>

        <center>
            <img src="ccbc16_mc.png" width="33%" />
        </center><br/>

        <h3>META: 指南</h3>
        Nothing much to say about this one. I have no printer available, so I'm just really glad they chose an origami that's easy to visualize without having to actually fold it.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Round 3</h2>
        The puzzles in this round are really fun! The first thing you notice is that something strange is going on here, with lots of puzzles being empty. Even now, I'm still not sure what those are for.<br/><br/>

        My only unsolved ones are 五彩斑斓的无字天书 and 只说明书, and ended up backsolving them. 五彩斑斓的无字天书 is simply impossible for a non-Chinese speaker, a big "nope" for me. 只说明书 seems long, though I just solved one subpuzzle "周游谜" and liked the concept of it.<br/>

        <h3>图寻: Image search</h3>
        When I first opened the puzzle, my first thought was "Is this like that 'scale of the universe' webpage that scrolls really really far horizontally?". Turns out it was wrong, but it was on the right track.<br/><br/>

        The hint says the entire puzzle references a painting, and the aspect ratio helps. I searched "longest Chinese painting/scroll", and I found "Along the River During the Qingming Festival". For a long time I refused to believe this was the answer since I couldn't believe it extracts to anything meaningful.<br/><br/>

        It was until I actually tried overlaying the puzzle image with the painting, I realized the numbers matches perfectly with the Chinese characters! I still struggled for a bit though, since I can't read the Chinese characters. Luckily there was a hint that was just "here is the list the characters if you can't read them lol". :heh:<br/>

        <h3>烫烫烫: Hot hot hot</h3>
        I loved this puzzle a lot. For some reason I'm always fascinated by these "technical/programming" type of puzzles. The puzzle was about different encoding systems, and the execution was done pretty nicely. The subpuzzles were pretty fun to solve (except for the 4x4 grid of chars, which we hinted since we don't speak Chinese). The reference to Steins;Gate was a neat surprise!<br/>

        <h3>氏毛米页: [illegible]</h3>
        I also loved this one a lot. Previously in round 1, there was a logic puzzle that required non-uniqueness to extract the answer. This one takes it to another level! Now you <i>have</i> to ensure that each logic puzzle is unique by inserting the appropriate clues. The final grid spelling out LETO was a very nice touch.<br/><br/>

        <center>
            <img src="ccbc16_leto.png" width="33%" />
        </center><br/>

        <h3>先有鸡还是先有蛋？: The chicken or the egg?</h3>
        The construction of this puzzle is beautiful! :ikuwow:<br/><br/>

        This is a minimeta, but all the feeders reference each other! Each feeder plays an important role too ensure the entire puzzle can be reconstructed: Some feeders give away their length, while some give you enough logic to determine the entire shape. Then, all the other feeders reference each other to form some "dependency chain" of letters, so figuring out the letters essentially reduces to solving a cryptogram!<br/>

        <h3>只剩提取: Extraction</h3>
        I also really love this one. It seems all the puzzles in this round have something in common: A significant chunk of the puzzle has been "inked out", and you have to use the remains to reconstruct the puzzle, or at least extract the final answer from it. This puzzle starts off normal with like ①②③④④⑤①③② which is easily <a href="https://www.quinapalus.com/qat.html">Qat</a>-able, then it slowly gets more and more cursed by introducing <i>rotated</i> and <i>overlapping numbers</i>, and bringing in encodings like <i>semaphore</i> and <i>braille</i> to the mix! It's a dream of mine to come up with puzzles like that.<br/>

        <h3>META: 印刷</h3>
        Nothing much to say about the meta. I did struggle with figuring out the group for PAPER, but I asked ChatGPT, which pointed me to the "Four Treasures of Study".<br/><br/>

        Also the nature of this meta makes it very easy to backsolve puzzles. In fact, that's the reason why most puzzles in this round are empty; you're meant to backsolve them! I tried asking ChatGPT to help with some of the associations with these blank puzzles, but it seems they got it all wrong. I mean, it doesn't hurt to just bruteforce all possible answers from the meta, 20 guesses is a lot to work with.<br/><br/>

        Anyways, after trying to backsolve the remaining puzzles in this round, it's time to move on to Round 4.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Round 4</h2>
        This round reminded me a lot of the IKEA round from a previous <a href="https://puzzlehunt.club.cc.cmu.edu/hunt/25/view/">CMU puzzlehunt</a>. Categorizing the fragments into puzzles was pretty easy. An exception to this is the pentagon puzzles, where the main difficulty lies on categorizing which of the two puzzles they actually belong.<br/><br/>

        原来你也是厨神 was solved by my friend, who is very knowledgeable about Genshin!<br/><br/>

        Our two unsolved ones in this round are 淡黄又蓬松 and 汉字方阵·后半, where me and my friend both agreed is practically impossible for us. 淡黄又蓬松 is an audio puzzle, which we can't do since audio is a pain to work with. :nanagrrr: Maybe if an audio transcriber for Chinese exists, we would do it. 汉字方阵·后半 is a Chinese crossword with a weird gimmick. In the end we ended up backsolving them.<br/><br/>

        A few puzzles in this round are particularly memorable to me:<br/>

        <h3>代入演算: Substitution and calculation</h3>
        Lambda calculus!!! I fully expected this puzzle to go <i>crazy wild</i> with its lambda expressions, since it's very easy to make the numbers explode into something big, like <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=909">Problem 909: L-Expressions</a> from Project Euler (which I haven't solved yet). Fortunately, the lambda expressions here are pretty tame. I cheesed it by just translating the puzzle into a bunch of <span class="code">lambda x: ...</span> lines in Python and evaluating it, which returned the answer pretty quickly.<br/>

        <h3>柏拉图式相爱: Platonic Love, and ？？？式相爱: ???-style Love</h3>
        This one is WILD. Absolutely INSANE that it even works. At first I was dreading to translate <i>all of these images</i>, but in the end I decided I <i>have</i> to do it.

        Luckily, Gemini allows for unlimited number of image uploads, so I abused it by just uploading all the images in this puzzle and had Gemini translate them for me. I also had to double-check whether they transcribed it properly. They made a few mistakes, like not translating "sum of digits" properly, but otherwise it was perfect. This took me a long time to do.<br/><br/>

        The next thing I did was summarize all the pentagons into a table, and used Python to examine which connections are possible between them.<br/><br/>

        I took a guess that 柏拉图式相爱 is probably a dodecahedron and only 10 pentagons will be needed, so I looked for a dodecahedron net online and started working on the puzzle in Krita. I solved it like a logic puzzle, starting with the most "contrained" hexagon. A lot of times I thought I ended up with a contradiction, but it turns out not all the pentagons are actually needed. Some of them belong to the other puzzle,  ？？？式相爱.<br/><br/>

        Finally, I constructed the dodecahedron. The flavortext says to take the differences between antipodes, and the answer becomes like that. I'm surprised how they even managed to construct this puzzle to begin with.<br/>

        <center>
            <img src="ccbc16_dodeca.png" width="33%" />
        </center>

        But, the next puzzle, ？？？式相爱, is even more insane. There are 10 pentagons left over from the previous puzzle, but what solid must be formed now? A dodecahedron wouldn't be possible since it run into contradictions, so maybe there's a solid that requires 10 pentagons and some other shaped-faces.<br/><br/>

        I asked Gemini, "what polyhedron has 20 faces, 10 of which are pentagons"? They pointed me to the <i>truncated icosahedron</i>! I knew this had to be correct, because the flavortext mentions {20}, and this solid has 20 hexagonal faces. I constructed the polyhedron the same way as the previous puzzle, but this time the extra hexagons are for filler.<br/><br/>

        The final step is what kinda amazing: To extract the final answer, each hexagon should be filled in with an integer. It turns out, if you take the three pentagon sides in line of sight of each hexagon, there is a <i>unique</i> integer (in most cases) which satisfies all three conditions! Just... how did they manage to construct all that?! That must be some pure sorcery...<br/><br/>

        <center>
            <img src="ccbc16_soccer.png" width="25%" />
        </center><br/>

        This might be my new favorite "construct the polyhedron" puzzle of all time. :ikuwow: The "mindblowingness" of the final step more than makes up for the tedium of the initial steps of the puzzle.<br/>

        <h3>META: 火药</h3>
        Something funny happened in this meta. We had to hint the first step of this puzzle, but after that we hit a roadblock: The final extraction uses the Chinese Commerical Code system, which meant the final answer had to be a Chines phrase.<br/><br/>

        I've decided I <i>will not</i> be solving the two remaining unsolved puzzles, which are clearly impossible. So, I have to somehow get the final answer from "給?一?焰???".<br/><br/>

        Being non-Chinese speakers, this was particularly hard to figure out. I had a few ideas, like 給他 is a common Chinese phrase, and 焰色 is an important thing in this puzzle. The furthest I got was "給他一点焰色??". In the end, I couldn't figure out the last two characters no matter how I tried, so I decided to write a custom hint.<br/><br/>

        I wrote the custom hint in Chinese. I said that we're non-Chinese speakers and are struggling in the final phrase, and that "給他一点焰色??" was the best we could come up with. To our surprise, they answered in English! :nanaxd: They basically just gave us the final answer. Their response to our hint request, which I thought was really funny:<br/><br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">You are very close. "給" should be "给", as we use simplified Chinese. Since you are not Chinese, I will give you the correct answer, "给他一点焰色看看", a pun to "给他一点颜色看看".</div><br/>

        And with that, Round 4 is done! We're off to the final round of the entire puzzlehunt.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Final Round</h2>

        This round... was <b><i>HELL</i></b>. It's all nazo puzzles, all of which rely on Chinese knowledge. These puzzles are probably very easy for native Chinese speakers, but we are not one of them.<br/><br/>

        千字谜 requires having the puzzle 四方谜 from Round 1 solved, so it looks like we're never touching that.<br/>

        <h3>叶子戏</h3>

        I used hints here very liberally. By very, I mean <i><b>very very</b></i>, to the point where we just <b><i>opened every single hint in this puzzle</b></i>, all 54 of them! Even then, it still required nontrivial effort to parse the hints to solve each question. The idea of 54 different nazo puzzles sounds incredible, but it's a shame we can't understand most of them.<br/>

        <h3>2025年度解谜能力测试</h3>

        This one was pretty fun. Half the questions require Chinese knowledge, but the other half only require English. I was able to solve all the English knowledge ones and most of the Chinese ones. I also hinted the remaining ones I haven't solved to. Once I've solved as much as I can, I submitted the answers, giving me a score of 97/100.<br/><br/>

        The final step though, I didn't get because I don't speak Chinese. I had to custom hint this one. Apparently the last step required picking a very specific set of answers for the multiple choice questions, which spell out a sentence in Chinese. Unfortunately I had no way of figuring this out, so I'm glad I hinted that.<br/>

        <h3>三字谜</h3>

        Oh boy. Chinese <a href="https://jacklance.github.io/octogram">Octogram</a>, a nice tribute to Jack Lance. Unfortunately, I struggled <b>a lot</b> due to the language barrier. I had to use <b><i>every single tool</i></b> at my disposal: qhanzi.com, chengyu.qianp.com, Baidu Baike, <a href="https://zi.tools">zi.tools</a>, and AI.<br/><br/>

        I had to hint on row 7, which I didn't get since it was apparently about Chinese character components. The difficult thing about these is that you don't know exactly what radical should be added to each character. I had to custom hint this one. I wrote the hint request in Chinese, yet they replied to us in English. :kanadespittake: I still find that pretty funny.

        After that, I immediately got stuck on row 8, which I had to hint again. This time though, something... <i>very strange</i> had happened.<br/><br/>

        When I looked at the puzzle page again, I noticed that <i>most of the answers have already magically been filled out</i>. At first I thought it was my friend solving these, but it can't be because they were busy the entire day. When I tried solving one of the puzzles and unlocked the next row, I notice one of the puzzles in the new row has been solved too! This was when I realized: have the puzzle admins actually entered these answers, for me?<br/><br/>

        I mean, it's pretty funny, and I'm not complaining! :nanaxd: I honestly just really wanted to get this done with. Eventually I got stuck again, and sent a hint request. The puzzle admins claim that what happened was just a "team sync bug", but I kinda doubt it, since the exact same thing also happened in the Lingo puzzle.<br/><br/>

        Even with that, I'm still left stuck here again. At this point, I've already sunk 4 custom hints for this puzzle, with the last one yet to unlock (since custom hints only unlock 1.5 hours after it was sent) and still haven't solved it.<br/><br/>

        <h3>你说话带括号</h3>

        Chinese <a href="https://lingothegame.com">Lingo</a>!!! I'm a big fan of Lingo, so seeing this made me smile... I'm sure IcelyPuzzles would be happy to see this.<br/><br/>

        When going through the first few questions, I quickly got stuck; not because I don't understand the mechanic, but because of Chinese language check again.<br/>
        I got stuck on the ｟｠ mechanic. The way it works is that the answer to ｟x｠ is an abbreviation, where x is the part outside the abbreviation. For an example in English, ｟EVIATION｠ = ABBR, because "ABBREVIATION" is abbreviated to "ABBR", with the outside part being EVIATION. You can see how this is very difficult to me in Chinese.<br/><br/>

        I had to custom hint this one, and the puzzle admins were kind enough to give me the answer to this set. And then something weird happened again: The same bug from the Octogram puzzle appeared again! Most of the answers have been filled out. Most of them in fact, that the entire puzzle is already solved! :chokodestroy:<br/><br/>

        Welp, I guess a solve is a solve, right?<br/><br/>

        <h2>Endgame</h2>

        At this point, it is 19:00; there's only an hour left in the hunt. The final meta is not yet unlocked, since I think it required answering 4/5 of the feeders. 千字谜 is unsolvable, so the only one left I needed was 三字谜, which was also really hard.<br/><br/>

        My custom hint to that puzzle had just unlocked, and I asked my friend to help finish this puzzle off. The final questions of 三字谜 involved weird meta shenanigans, where some answers to questions depend on answers to previous or future ones. Nonetheless, we still manage to solve it at 19:45, with 15 minutes left until hunt ends!<br/><br/>

        Finally, the final meta has unlocked. And... we were greeting with a giant picture with lots of boxes to fill in. Yeah, we're never solving that in just 15 minutes. To make things worse, the hints for this puzzle are also locked, so we can't just cheese our way through this. The hints only unlock at 20:45, which is... 45 minutes after hunt ends! Hahaha. :nanacry:<br/><br/>

        I guess this is where we finally end with the hunt, so close to the finish line.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        I had a lot of fun with this hunt. I'm surprised I was even able to reach this far, considering I'm only doing the hunt mostly solo, and having 0 Chinese knowledge. I never expected to be able to finish the entire hunt anyways. The hunt had lots of fun puzzles and crazy ideas, even transcending the language barrier.<br/><br/>

        I also learned a lot of new things this hunt. It was the first time I used tools like chengyu.qianp.com for Chinese idioms and zi.tools for character decompositions, which proved to be very helpful. I also realized I relied <i>a lot</i> on ChatGPT and Gemini throughout the hunt, mainly for English translation of almost all puzzles in the hunt for me. Gemini especially helped with transcribing images, since Google Translate won't do it properly.<br/><br/>

        I'm very thankful for my friend who lent me a helping hand, since without it I probably would have given up on Round 1 already. :bebelove:<br/><br/>

        Thank you for reading through this blog post! ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و<br/><br/>
