 Level ideas:
1. Let box fall on you where box is push
2. Deactivate/activate a rule using gravity
3. text stacking
4. deactivate rule but not really separate text
5. wall is box is wall (infinite loop?)
6. prison trick
7. use the borders/ceiling of the level as "walls"
8. change the "you" object
9. Make a defeat object and "you" text fall at the same time to avoid defeat
10. alternate jumping with two "you" objects
11. Push two text upward at once
12. move faster with you&move
13. move faster with you&you2
14. window is bounce

Bugs:
1. Make BABA IS ALL less laggy
2. FIX RULE PRIORITIES/RULE ORDER
3. BABA AND BABA IS MOVE only interprets once
4. BABA IS YOU AND SWAP completely destroys everything, and also BABA IS YOU AND MOVE
5. OPen and shut for zawarudo, and also all other effects for zawarudo
6. weak when pushed against a border
7. BABA ON KEKE AND KEKE does not work, BABA FACING KEKE AND KEKE and BABA NEAR KEKE AND KEKE as well
8. GHOST IS BABA IS YOU makes the game crash
9. BABA IS YOU and BOX IS STOP AND MOVE, hold right towards the box should not ride it
10. bug as in #9: "they can climb the moving wall if they are fast enough"
11. BABA IS YOU and BABA IS WIN does not make win

Implementation:
1. Baba is Baba should do rule cancelling (those red X's)
2. What does "Baba is Box is Baba" do? (infinite loop?)
3. Death/Sink/Open-Shut/Sleep particle effects
4. Smoke particles for hot?
5. make tilegrid more efficient
6. rewrite rule interpreter's code to accept conditions and prefix
7. make BEST a raycast?
8. Textismove must be fixed for optimization
9. UNDO SYSTEM!!!!!!!
10. window is bounce
11. window is hide
12. Make ON more efficient
13. BABA ON KEKE IS FLAG must be cancelled by BABA IS BABA
14. BABA IS NOT BABA and NOT KEKE IS NOT BABA

To-do:
EMPTY GROUP
MAKE FEAR NOT
TELE WORD BEST
