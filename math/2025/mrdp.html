        <h1>MRDP Theorem: Polynomial equations are "Turing-complete"</h1>

        <p class="date">June ??, 2024. ??:??pm</p>

        Let's talk about polynomials. As a warmup, try solving the following question:<br/><br/>

        <div class="problem">For which values of $k$ does the quadratic equation $x^2-6x+25-k^2=0$ have at least one real root?</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Solution.</b></summary>

        For the quadratic equation to have at least one real root, its <b>discriminant</b> has to be nonnegative.
        $$D=(-6)^2-4(25-k^2)=4k^2-64$$
        Solving the inequality $4k^2-64\ge0$ gives us $\boxed{k\le-4\text{ or }k\ge4}$, which is the answer.</details><br/>

        Those of you who've been in a lot of math contests might already know how to solve these kinds of problems.<br/><br/>

        Problems like these are a bit boring, since there's really only one "routine" way to solve it. Even if we change the numbers in the problem, the solution stays more or less the same.<br/><br/>

        Now, let's try concerning ourselves with only <b>integers</b>.<br/><br/>

        <div class="problem">For which <b>integer</b> values of $k$ does the quadratic equation $x^2-6x+25-k^2=0$ have at least one <b>integer</b> root?</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Solution.</b></summary>

        Completing the square on the left hand side gives
        $$(x-3)^2+16-k^2=0$$
        After factoring out difference of two squares, we get
        $$(x-3-k)(x-3+k)=-16$$
        This means $(x-3-k)$ and $(x-3+k)$ must both be integer factors that multiply to $-16$. Furthermore, since $(x-3-k)$ and $(x-3+k)$ share the same parity, they must both be even numbers.<br/><br/>

        There are only a few ways this could happen:
        $$\begin{cases}x-3-k=-8\\x-3+k=2\end{cases}\implies(x,k)=(0,5)$$
        $$\begin{cases}x-3-k=-4\\x-3+k=4\end{cases}\implies(x,k)=(3,4)$$
        $$\begin{cases}x-3-k=-2\\x-3+k=8\end{cases}\implies(x,k)=(6,5)$$
        $$\begin{cases}x-3-k=2\\x-3+k=-8\end{cases}\implies(x,k)=(6,-5)$$
        $$\begin{cases}x-3-k=4\\x-3+k=-4\end{cases}\implies(x,k)=(3,-4)$$
        $$\begin{cases}x-3-k=8\\x-3+k=-2\end{cases}\implies(x,k)=(0,-5)$$
        From above, we find that only the values $\boxed{k=-5,-4,4,5}$ yield integer solutions for $x$.</details><br/>

        This time, the solution becomes a bit more complicated. In the real case, we had infinitely many values for $k$. But in the integer case, suddenly there are only finitely many of them.<br/><br/>

        The solution also heavily depends on the numbers we choose for the problem. For example, if we just changed $25$ to something else, the possible values for $k$ wildly changes!<br/><br/>

        Even worse, look what happens if we change only the coefficient of $x^2$.<br/><br/>

        <div class="problem">For which integer values of $k$ does the quadratic equation $2x^2-6x+25-k^2=0$ have at least one integer root?</div><br/>

        Suddenly, the list of possible values for $k$ becomes infinite again, and follow a strange pattern!
        $$k=9,21,49,121,285,705,1661,4109,9681,\ldots$$
        Equations that look like this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation">Pell's equation</a>, a class of equations that's been heavily studied in the field of number theory.<br/><br/>

        There are also other ways to modify this equation to give interesting results. We could experiment with any polynomial equation, other than just quadratic. We can also increase the number of variables for more degrees of freedom.<br/><br/>

        The question we'll be answering today is: What possible solution sets could we get from any math problem of this form?<br/><br/>

        <div class="problem">For which integer values of $k$ does the polynomial equation ＿＿＿ have at least one integer root?</div><br/>

        The answer is, well, very surprising. It is <i>almost anything</i> you could possibly think of. As the title says, they are "Turing-complete", in some sense.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Definitions</h2>

        Before we proceed, let us first lay down some definitions.<br/><br/>

        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_set"><b>Diophantine equation</b></a> is a polynomial equation of the form
        $$P(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y_1,\ldots,y_n)=0$$
        where $P$ is any multivariable polynomial with integer coefficients. $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ indicate parameters and $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ indicate unknowns.<br/><br/>

        The name comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantus">Diophantus</a>, who is among the first people to study such equations.<br/><br/>

        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_set"><b>Diophantine set</b></a> is a subset $S$ of $\mathbb N^k$ for which there exist a multivariable polynomial $P$ with integer coefficients such that,
        $$(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\in S\iff(\exists y_1,\ldots,y_n\in\mathbb N)[P(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y_1,\ldots,y_n)=0]$$
        In other words, we say that a <b>Diophantine set</b> is any set of integers (or integer tuples) that could possibly be the answer to the question "For which values of $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ does the  polynomial equation ＿＿＿ have an integer solution in $y_1,\ldots,y_n$?"<br/><br/>

        By the way, <span style="color:red"><b>0 is considered a natural number.</b></span><br/><br/>

        In the introduction, we looked at the Diophantine equation $2x^2-6x+25-k^2=0$. Here, $k$ is the parameter and $x$ is the unknown. The Diophantine set is the set of integer values for $k$ which permits an integer solution for $x$.<br/><br/>

        Here are a few simple examples of Diophantine sets, to get a feel for them. These ones only involve one parameter:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>EVEN is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set of even integers $\{0,2,4,6,8,10,\ldots\}$ is a Diophantine set.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$x-2y=0$$
        where $x$ is the parameter and $y$ is the unknown.<br/><br/>

        The equation has an integer solution in $y$ if and only if $x$ is an even integer.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>PERFECTSQUARE is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set of perfect squares $\{0,1,4,9,16,25,\ldots\}$ is a Diophantine set.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$x-y^2=0$$
        where $x$ is the parameter and $y$ is the unknown.<br/><br/>

        The equation has an integer solution in $y$ if and only if $x$ is a perfect square.</details><br/>

        Here are some Diophantine sets that involve multiple parameters:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$\lt$ is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(x_1,x_2)\in\mathbb N^2\mid x_1\lt x_2\}$ is a Diophantine set.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$x_1+y+1-x_2=0$$
        where $x_1,x_2$ are the parameters and $y$ is the unknown.<br/><br/>

        The equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $y$ if and only if $x_1+1\le x_2$.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$\ne$ is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(x_1,x_2)\in\mathbb N^2\mid x_1\ne x_2\}$ is a Diophantine set.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$(x_1+y+1-x_2)(x_2+y+1-x_1)=0$$
        where $x_1,x_2$ are the parameters and $y$ is the unknown.<br/><br/>

        The equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $y$ if and only if either $x_1\lt x_2$ or $x_2\lt x_1$.</details><br/>

        <h3>The difference between $\mathbb N$ or $\mathbb Z$</h3>

        Notice that our definition for Diophantine set uses $\mathbb N$ instead of $\mathbb Z$. This is because it's easier to avoid thinking about negative integers when dealing with Diophantine sets.<br/><br/>

        It turns out, it doesn't matter whether we use $\mathbb N$ or $\mathbb Z$, as shown below:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$\mathbb N$ is Diophantine.</b><br/>

        There exist a Diophantine equation $P(x,y_1,y_2,\ldots)=0$ such that $x$ is a nonnegative integer if and only if the equation has a (possibly negative) integer solution in $y_1,y_2,\ldots$.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$x-y_1^2-y_2^2-y_3^2-y_4^2=0$$
        where $x$ is the parameter and $y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4$ are the unknowns.<br/><br/>

        Clearly, $x=y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2+y_4^2\ge0$, so $x$ is a nonnegative integer.<br/><br/>

        Conversely, if $x$ is a nonnegative integer, then according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem">Lagrange's four-square theorem</a>, $x$ can be represented as a sum of four perfect squares, so $x=y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2+y_4^2$.</details><br/>

        So even if we changed the definition for Diophantine sets to be over $\mathbb Z$ instead of $\mathbb N$, we can still force the $\mathbb N$ restriction to be there. For example, take our example from earlier:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$\lt$ is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        Let $x_1,x_2$ be integers, and let $S=\{(x_1,x_2)\in\mathbb N^2\mid x_1\lt x_2\}$.<br/>
        There exist a Diophantine equation $P(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2,\ldots)=0$ such that $(x_1,x_2)\in S$ if and only if the equation has a (possibly negative) integer solution in $y_1,y_2,\ldots$.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        Earlier we considered the Diophantine equation
        $$x_1+y+1-x_2=0$$
        But this only works if $x_1,x_2,y$ are restricted to natural numbers. To fix this, we introduce 4 new unknowns for each variable like this:
        $$\begin{cases}x_1-w_1^2-w_2^2-w_3^2-w_4^2=0\\x_2-w_5^2-w_6^2-w_7^2-w_8^2=0\\y-w_9^2-w_{10}^2-w_{11}^2-w_{12}^2=0\end{cases}$$
        Each equation here forces the restriction $x_1,x_2,y\in\mathbb N$.<br/><br/>

        Combining this together, we have the following Diophantine equation in $\mathbb Z$:
        \begin{align*}
        &(x_1+y+1-x_2)^2+(x_1-w_1^2-w_2^2-w_3^2-w_4^2)^2\\
        &+(x_2-w_5^2-w_6^2-w_7^2-w_8^2)^2+(y-w_9^2-w_{10}^2-w_{11}^2-w_{12}^2)^2=0\end{align*}
        where $x_1,x_2$ are the parameters and $y,w_1,\ldots,w_{12}$ are the unknowns.<br/><br/>

        The Diophantine equation has an integer solution in $y,w_1,\ldots,w_{12}$ if and only if $x_1,x_2,y\in\mathbb N$, and $x_1\lt x_2$.</details><br/>

        This means we don't have to worry about negative integers at all.<br/><br/>

        <h2>More examples of Diophantine sets</h2>

        The following are a bit trickier to show, but they are all Diophantine sets. Feel free to try proving them yourself first before looking at the proofs.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>COMPOSITE is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set of composite numbers, $\{4,6,8,9,10,12,\ldots\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$x-(a+2)(b+2)=0$$
        where $x$ is the parameter and $a,b$ are the unknowns.<br/><br/>

        The equation has a positive integer solution in $a$ and $b$ if and only if $x$ can be expressed as a product of two integers $\ge2$, i.e. $x$ is a composite number.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$\lnot$POWEROFTWO is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set of integers that are not powers of two, $\{0,3,5,6,7,9,10,\ldots\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$x-a(2b+3)=0$$
        where $x$ is the parameter and $a,b$ are the unknowns.<br/><br/>

        The equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $a$ and $b$ if and only if $x$ has an odd divisor $\ge3$, which is precisely when $x$ is not a power of two.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$\lnot$PERFECTSQUARE is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set of integers that are not perfect squares, $\{2,3,5,6,7,8,\ldots\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        The main idea is to look at equations of the form
        $$x^2-ny^2=1$$
        where $n$ is a positive integer. This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_equation">Pell equation</a>, and it only has positive integer solutions in $x,y$ if and only if $n$ is not a perfect square.<br/><br/>

        This fact is a bit complicated to prove, so interested readers may read up about its proof somewhere else online.<br/><br/>

        With this in mind, consider the Diophantine equation
        $$((x+1)^2-n(y+1)^2-1)^2+(n-z-1)^2=0$$
        where $n$ is the parameter, and $x,y,z$ are the unknowns.<br/><br/>

        For the equation to be satisfied, we need both of these to be true for some $x,y,z$:
        $$\begin{cases}(x+1)^2-n(y+1)^2=1\\n=z+1\end{cases}$$
        The first equation is our Pell equation. Since $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative, this forces $x+1$ and $y+1$ to be positive integers. The second equation forces $n\ge1$.<br/><br/>

        The Diophantine equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $x,y,z$ if and only if $n\ne0$ and not a perfect square.</details><br/>

        These ones involve multiple parameters:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$\lnot$COPRIME is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(a,b)\in\mathbb N^2\mid \gcd(a,b)\ne1\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$(a-xy)^2+(b-xz)^2+(x-w-2)^2=0$$
        where $a,b$ are parameters and $x,y,z,w$ are unknowns.<br/><br/>

        For the equation to be satisfied, we need all three of these to be true for some $x,y,z,w$:
        $$\begin{cases}a-xy=0\\b-xz=0\\x-w-2=0\end{cases}$$
        The first two ensures that $a,b$ have a common factor $x$, and the third one ensures that $x\ge2$.<br/><br/>

        The Diophantine equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $x,y,z,w$ if and only if $a,b$ share a common factor $\ge2$.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>COPRIME is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(a,b)\in\mathbb N^2\mid \gcd(a,b)=1\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$ax-by=1$$
        where $a,b$ are parameters and $x,y$ are unknowns.<br/><br/>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézout%27s_identity">Bézout's lemma</a> says this equation has an integer solution in $x$ and $y$ if and only if $a,b$ are coprime.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>floorsqrt is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(a,b)\in\mathbb N^2\mid a=\lfloor\sqrt b\rfloor\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        The equation $a=\lfloor\sqrt b\rfloor$ is equivalent to saying $a\le\sqrt b\lt a+1$, which is then equivalent to saying $a^2\le b\lt(a+1)^2$.<br/><br/>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$(a^2+x-b)^2+(b+y+1-(a+1)^2)^2=0$$
        where $a,b,c$ are parameters and $x,y$ are unknowns.<br/><br/>

        For the equation to be satisfied, we need both of these to be true for some $x,y$:
        $$\begin{cases}a^2=b-x\\b=(a+1)^2-y-1\end{cases}$$
        The first one ensures $a^2\le b$, while the second one ensures $b\lt(a+1)^2$.<br/><br/>

        The Diophantine equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $x,y$ if and only if $a^2\le b\lt(a+1)^2$, or equivalently, $a=\lfloor\sqrt b\rfloor$.</details><br/>

        <h3>Operations on Diophantine sets</h3>

        If you've looked at any of the last examples, you probably already know that we can combine Diophantine sets together with union or intersection, as if they were AND, OR logical operators.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>Diophantine sets are closed under AND.</b><br/>
        The intersection of two Diophantine sets is also Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Let $A$ and $B$ be Diophantine sets, and let $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$ and $Q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$ be their corresponding Diophantine equations. Then a Diophantine equation for $A\cap B$ is
        $$P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^2+Q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^2=0$$
        which works because $p^2+q^2=0$ iff $p=0$ and $q=0$.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>Diophantine sets are closed under OR.</b><br/>
        The union of two Diophantine sets is also Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Let $A$ and $B$ be Diophantine sets, and let $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$ and $Q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$ be their corresponding Diophantine equations. Then a Diophantine equation for $A\cup B$ is
        $$P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)Q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$$
        which works because $pq=0$ iff $p=0$ or $q=0$.</details><br/>

        Using this, we can start treating logical statements as if they were subsets of $\mathbb N$, and we can also classify whether they are Diophantine or not. We can start constructing statements like
        $$(x\text{ is composite})\land[(y\text{ is not a power of two})\lor(\gcd(x,y)=1)]$$
        and say they are Diophantine. This lets us "abstractify" most of the things we do with polynomial equations.<br/><br/>

        The earlier examples with PERFECTSQUARE and $\lnot$PERFECTSQUARE might lead us to believe that Diophantine sets are also closed under complement. Unfortunately, this is not possible, as we'll see much later.<br/><br/>

        The following two examples are particularly important since they allow us to perform operations beyond simple addition and multiplication.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="mod"><b>mod is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(a,b,c)\in\mathbb N^3\mid a\bmod b=c\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$(a-c-bx)^2+(c+y+1-b)^2=0$$
        where $a,b,c$ are parameters and $x,y$ are unknowns.<br/><br/>

        For the equation to be satisfied, we need both of these to be true for some $x,y$:
        $$\begin{cases}a=c+bx\\c=b-y-1\end{cases}$$
        The first one ensures that $a\equiv c\pmod b$, while the second ensures that $c\lt b$.<br/><br/>

        The Diophantine equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $x,y$ if and only if $a\bmod b=c$.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="floordiv"><b>floordiv is Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(a,b,c)\in\mathbb N^3\mid\lfloor a/b\rfloor=c\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        The statement $\lfloor a/b\rfloor=c$ is equivalent to saying $c\le a/b\lt c+1$, which is then equivalent to saying $bc\le a$ and $a\lt b(c+1)$.<br/><br/>

        Consider the Diophantine equation
        $$(bc+x-a)^2+(a+y+1-b(c+1))^2=0$$
        where $a,b,c$ are parameters and $x,y$ are unknowns.<br/><br/>

        For the equation to be satisfied, we need both of these to be true for some $x,y$:
        $$\begin{cases}bc=a-x\\a=b(c+1)-y-1\end{cases}$$
        The first one ensures $bc\le a$, while the second one ensures $a\lt b(c+1)$.<br/><br/>

        The Diophantine equation has a nonnegative integer solution in $x,y$ if and only if $bc\le a\lt b(c+1)$, or equivalently, $\lfloor a/b\rfloor=c$.</details><br/>

        For example, suppose we wanted to show the set $\{(a,b)\in\mathbb N^2\mid\lfloor a/b\rfloor\equiv4\pmod 5\}$ is Diophantine.<br/><br/>

        To do this, all we have to do is "store" the value of $\lfloor a/b\rfloor$ as a new variable $c$, then check whether $c\bmod 5$ equals 4. Since we already showed that mod and floordiv are Diophantine, we can rewrite them as polynomial equations.
        \begin{align*}
        \lfloor a/b\rfloor\equiv4\pmod5\quad&\iff\quad\exists c\,[(c=\lfloor a/b\rfloor)\land(c\bmod 5=4)]\\
        &\iff\quad\exists c,x,y,z\,[(a-c-bx)^2+(c+y+1-b)^2+(c-4-5z)^2=0]
        \end{align*}

        <h2>Exponential Diophantine</h2>

        Even though Diophantine sets seem like it could express lots of things, some sets still seem very hard to figure out.<br/><br/>

        Consider the set of powers of two, $\{1,2,4,8,16,32,\ldots\}$. Is this a Diophantine set? If you could show that it is, then congratulations! You are super smart! :nanaclap: Otherwise, it seems very out of reach for now.<br/><br/>

        How can we even express anything <i>exponential</i> with just polynomial equations? Let's introduce a new class of equations which allows more power.<br/><br/>

        <h3>Definition</h3>

        An <b>exponential Diophantine equation</b> is just like a Diophantine equation, but exponentiation is also allowed. Expressions like $x^y$ (where $x,y$ are variables) can now be used in the equation.<br/><br/>

        Formally, an exponential Diophantine equation is anything of the form
        $$Q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$$
        where $Q$ is a sum of terms $y_1^{z_1}\cdots y_k^{z_k}$, where each $y_i$ and $z_i$ can be any polynomial expression.<br/><br/>

        An <b>exponential Diophantine set</b> is a subset $S$ of $\mathbb N^k$ for which there exist an exponential Diophantine equation with integer coefficients such that,
        $$(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\in S\iff(\exists y_1,\ldots,y_n)[Q(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y_1,\ldots,y_n)=0]$$
        In other words, an exponential Diophantine set is any set of integers (or integer tuples) that could possibly be the answer to the question "For which values of $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ does the exponential Diophantine equation have an integer solution in $y_1,\ldots,y_n$?"<br/><br/>

        For example, here are some exponential Diophantine sets:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>POWEROFTWO is exponential Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set of powers of two, $\{1,2,4,8,16,32,\ldots\}$ is an exponential Diophantine set.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        Consider the exponential Diophantine equation
        $$x-2^y=0$$
        where $x$ is the parameter and $y$ is the unknown.<br/><br/>

        This equation has an integer solution in $y$ if and only if $x$ is a power of two.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>REPUNIT is exponential Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set of integers that only contain the digit 1, $\{1,11,111,1111,11111,111111,\ldots\}$ is an exponential Diophantine set.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        Every repunit $\underbrace{11\cdots11}_n$ is expressible in the form $(10^n-1)/9$.<br/><br/>

        Consider the exponential Diophantine equation
        $$9x-10^{n+1}+1=0$$
        where $x$ is the parameter and $n$ is the unknown.<br/><br/>

        The equation has an integer solution in $n$ if and only if $x$ is of the form $(10^{n+1}-1)/9=\underbrace{11\cdots11}_{n+1}$.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>Concatenation is exponential Diophantine.</b><br/>
        Let $S=\{(a,b,c)\in\mathbb N^3\mid\text{$c$ is the concatenation of $a$ and $b$}\}$. For example, $(123,45,12345)\in S$.<br/>
        Then $S$ is an exponential Diophantine set.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
        The concatenation of $a$ and $b$ can also be written as $a\cdot 10^n+b$, where $n$ is the number of digits of $b$, or equivalently, $10^{n-1}\le b\lt10^n$.<br/><br/>

        Consider the exponential Diophantine equation
        $$(c-a\cdot10^n-b)^2+(10^{n-1}+x-b)^2+(b+y+1-10^n)^2=0$$
        where $a,b,c$ are the parameters and $n,x,y$ are the unknowns.<br/><br/>

        For the equation to be satisfied, we need all three of these to be true for some $n,x,y$:
        $$\begin{cases}c=a\cdot10^n+b\\10^{n-1}=b-x\\b=10^n-y-1\end{cases}$$
        The last two equations ensure that $10^{n-1}\le b\lt10^n$, so that $n$ is exactly the number of digits of $b$.<br/></details><br/>

        Adding exponentiation into the mix might feel like cheating, since after all it's not quite what I promised in the title: we were only talking about <i>polynomial</i> equations, not exponential ones! For now, let's just see how far exponential Diophantine equations can take us.<br/><br/>

        <h3>More examples of exponential Diophantine sets</h3>

        It turns out, exponential Diophantine equations are extremely powerful and can do what ordinary Diophantine equations can't do easily. These next examples are quite surprising, see if you could figure out how to show that these are exponential Diophantine:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>$e$ is exponential Diophantine.</b><br/>
        Consider the digits of Euler's number $e=2.7182818\ldots$.<br/>
        The set $\{2,27,271,2718,27182,271828,\ldots\}$ is exponential Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Essentially, for every $n$ we want to approximate $e$ to $n$ decimal places then multiply it by $10^n$. The easiest way to do this would be to use the fact that
        $$\left(1+\frac 1x\right)^x\lt e\lt\left(1+\frac1x\right)^{x+1}$$
        for all $x$. Multiplying both sides by $10^n$, we have
        $$10^n\left(1+\frac 1x\right)^x\lt 10^n\cdot e\lt10^n\left(1+\frac1x\right)^{x+1}$$
        The gap between the left and right sides tend to 0 as $x\to\infty$, so there exists $x$ large enough such that $\lfloor 10^n(1+\frac 1x)^x\rfloor=\lfloor 10^n(1+\frac1x)\rfloor=\lfloor 10^n\cdot e\rfloor$.<br/><br/>

        If we let $m=\lfloor 10^n\cdot e\rfloor$, then we have $m=\lfloor 10^n(1+\frac 1x)^x\rfloor$, which is equivalent to $10^n(1+\frac 1x)^x\le m\lt10^n(1+\frac 1x)^x+1$.<br/><br/>

        Consider the following statement
        $$[10^n(x+1)^x\le x^x m\lt 10^n(x+1)^x + x^x]\land[10^n(x+1)^{x+1}\le x^x m\lt 10^n(x+1)^{x+1} + x^{x+1}]$$
        This statement can be satisfied for $m$ if and only if $m$ represents the first $n$ digits of $e$, with a large enough $x$ for the approximation.<br/><br/>

        It's easy to rewrite the inequalities into an exponential Diophantine equation with $m$ as parameter and $n,x$ as unknowns.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="binom"><b>Binomial coefficient is exponential Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(x,n,r)\mid x=\binom nr\}$ is exponential Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem">binomial theorem</a>. If we look at the base-$b$ representation of $(b+1)^n$ for large enough $b$, then we'll see that the $r$th digit is $\binom nr$.<br/><br/>

        We can retrieve the $r$th digit of the base-$b$ representation of any number by dividing it by $b^r$ and only take the units digit. We also need to ensure that $b$ is larger than $\binom nr$ itself, so taking $b>2^n$ is enough.<br/><br/>

        Consider the following statement
        $$(b>2^n)\land\left(x=\left\lfloor\frac{(b+1)^n}{b^r}\right\rfloor\bmod b\right)$$
        The first clause ensures that $b$ is big enough, and the second clause is what gives $x=\binom nr$.<br/><br/>

        We showed that it's possible to take the <a href="#mod">mod</a> and <a href="#floordiv">floordiv</a> of any number, so it's easy to convert this into an exponential Diophatine equation with $x,n,r$ as parameters and $b$ as an unknown.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="factorial"><b>Factorial is exponential Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(x,n)\mid x=n!\}$ is exponential Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        The main idea comes from the fact that
        $$\binom bn=\frac{b(b-1)\cdots(b-n+1)}{n!}\approx\frac{b^n}{n!}$$
        for all large enough $b$. Using this, it's enough to compute $\lfloor b^n/\binom bn\rfloor$ to obtain $n!$.<br/><br/>

        To ensure that such $b$ works, we want to make sure $n!\le b^n/\binom bn\lt n!+1$.<br/><br/>

        It's easy to show that $b^n/\binom bn\ge n!$ for all $b$, and it also turns out that choosing any $b\gt(2n)^{n+1}$ already guarantees that $b^n/\binom bn\lt n!+1$. (Left as an exercise to the reader :menherateehee:)<br/><br/>

        Consider the following statement
        $$(b>(2n)^{n+1})\land\left(x=\left\lfloor\frac{b^n}{\binom bn}\right\rfloor\right)$$
        The first clause ensures that $b$ is big enough, and the second clause is what gives $x=n!$.<br/><br/>

        We previously showed that it's possible to take the <a href="#floordiv">floordiv</a> of any number as well as <a href="#binom">binomial coefficients</a>, so it's easy to convert this into an exponential Diophantine equation with $x,n$ as parameters and $b$ as an unknown.</details><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="arith-seq"><b>Product of arithmetic sequence is exponential Diophantine.</b><br/>
        The set $\{(x,a,d,n)\mid x=a(a+d)(a+2d)\cdots(a+(n-1)d)\}$ is exponential Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Observe that
        \begin{align*}
        a(a+d)(a+2d)\cdots(a+(n-1)d)&=d^n\cdot \tfrac ad(\tfrac ad+1)(\tfrac ad+2)\cdots(\tfrac ad+n-1)\\
        &=d^n\cdot n!\binom{\frac ad+n-1}n
        \end{align*}
        so it's as if we could just use the fact that the binomial coefficient is exponential Diophantine to finish this off. Unfortunately, our proof for that doesn't quite work with fractional arguments.<br/><br/>

        However, we could get around this using a mod. If we let $M$ be some really large modulo and $q$ an integer such that $q\equiv\tfrac ad\pmod M$, then
        \begin{align*}
        a(a+d)(a+2d)\cdots(a+(n-1)d)&=d^n\cdot \tfrac ad(\tfrac ad+1)(\tfrac ad+2)\cdots(\tfrac ad+n-1)\\
        &\equiv d^n\cdot q(q+1)(q+2)\cdots(q+n-1)\pmod M\\
        &= d^n\cdot n!\binom{q+n-1}n
        \end{align*}
        Thus, we only need to compute $d^n\cdot n!\binom{q+n-1}n$ mod $M$ to obtain the product we want.<br/><br/>

        Consider the following statement
        $$(M>(a+nd)^n)\land(qd\bmod M=a)\land\left(x=d^n\cdot n!\binom{q-n-1}n\bmod M\right)$$
        The first one ensures $M$ is big enough, the second is for $q\equiv\tfrac ad\pmod M$, and the last clause is what gives $x=a(a+d)(a+2d)\cdots(a+(n-1)d)$.<br/><br/>

        We previously showed that it's possible to obtain <a href="#binom">binomial coefficients</a> and <a href="#factorial">factorials</a>, so it's easy to convert this into an exponential Diophantine equation with $x,a,d,n$ as parameters and $M,q$ asunknowns.</details><br/>

        <h2>Diophantine $\iff$ Exponential Diophantine</h2>

        Surprise surprise! It turns out, Diophantine sets and exponential Diophantine sets are <b>the exact same thing</b>! There's actually a way to express exponentiation using just polynomial equations.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>Exponentiation is Diophantine</b>.<br/>
        The set $\{(x,y,z)\mid x=y^z\}$ is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        However, the proof of this is... very <i>very</i> hard, but I'll try my best to explain the motivations behind them.<br/><br/>

        <h3>Pell equations</h3>

        Remember Pell equations? I briefly alluded to this at the introduction. Whenever you see any Diophantine equation of the form
        $$x^2-ny^2=1$$
        where $x$ and $y$ are unknowns, that's called a Pell equation. These kinds of equations are interesting, since their solutions follow a strange pattern.<br/><br/>

        For example, let's take a look at $x^2-2y^2=1$. Its first few solutions are
        $$(x,y)=(1,0),(3,2),(17,12),(99,70),(577,408),(3363,2378),(19601,13860),\ldots$$
        The solution set might look like a mess, but there's actually a nice way of generating this sequence:<br/><br/>

        Let's look at numbers of the form $a+b\sqrt2$. Every number of this form has its own <i>conjugate</i>, $a-b\sqrt2$. If you multiply this number with its conjugate, you get
        $$(a+b\sqrt2)(a-b\sqrt2)=a^2-2b^2$$
        Let's call this number the "norm" of $a+b\sqrt2$. Notice how $a^2-2b^2$ is exactly the same as our Pell equation!<br/><br/>

        The solutions to the Pell equation $x^2-2y^2=1$, are exactly the numbers of the form $x+y\sqrt2$ which has norm 1.<br/><br/>

        A very nice property of the norm is that it is <i>multiplicative</i>. In other words, if we had two numbers $a+b\sqrt2$ and $c+d\sqrt2$, then the norm of their product is equal to the product of their norms:
        \begin{align*}
        (a+b\sqrt2)(c+d\sqrt2) &= (ac+2bd)+(ad+bc)\sqrt2\\
        \text{norm of }a+b\sqrt2 &= a^2-2b^2\\
        \text{norm of }c+d\sqrt2 &= c^2-2d^2\\
        \text{norm of }(ac+2bd)+(ad+bc)\sqrt2 &= (ac+2bd)^2-2(ad+bc)^2=(a^2-2b^2)(c^2-2d^2)
        \end{align*}
        As an example, consider the number $(3-2\sqrt2)^n$. Its first few values are:
        \begin{align*}
        (3-2\sqrt2)^0 &= 1-0\sqrt2\\
        (3-2\sqrt2)^1 &= 3-2\sqrt2\\
        (3-2\sqrt2)^2 &= 17-12\sqrt2\\
        (3-2\sqrt2)^3 &= 99-70\sqrt2
        \end{align*}
        What's the norm of $(3-2\sqrt2)^n$? Since the norm of $3-2\sqrt2$ is $3^2-2\cdot2^2=1$, that means the norm of $(3-2\sqrt2)^n$ is always 1. Thus, the solutions of $x^2-2y^2=1$ are $(1,0),(3,2),(17,12),(99,70),\ldots$, are actually obtained by expanding $(3-2\sqrt2)^n$ for $n=0,1,2,\ldots$!<br/><br/>

        Pell equations may also come in other varieties. An equation of the form
        $$x^2-axy+y^2=1$$
        may also be called a Pell equation.<br/><br/>

        :todo:

        <h2>"For all" quantifiers</h2>

        So far, everything we know about Diophantine sets has to involve the "there exists" quantifier $\exists$. Every Diophantine set can be written as a formula in the form
        $$(\exists y_1,\ldots,y_n)[P(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y_1,\ldots,y_n)=0]$$
        However, there are some times where we might need the "for all" quantifier $\forall$.<br/><br/>

        For example, suppose we want to show that the set of all squarefree numbers $\{1,2,3,5,6,7,10,\ldots\}$ is a Diophantine set. The statement "$n$ is squarefree" may be written as
        $$(\forall k)\,[n\bmod (k+2)^2\ne0]$$
        We could write "$n\bmod (k+2)^2\ne0$" as
        $$(n-x-(k+2)^2y)^2+(z+1-x)^2+(x+w+1-(k+2)^2)^2=0$$
        But if we need this to be satisfied for all $k$, we'd need to combine infinitely many different equations together,
        $$\begin{cases}(n-x_0-4y_0)^2+(z_0+1-x_0)^2+(x_0+w_0-3)^2=0\\(n-x_1-9y_1)^2+(z_1+1-x_1)^2+(x_1+w_1-8)^2=0\\(n-x_2-16y_2)^2+(z_2+1-x_2)^2+(x_2+w_2-15)^2=0\\\vdots\end{cases}$$
        Something like this isn't possible, since that would require infinitely many variables!<br/><br/>

        It seems like there is no way to write "for all" using a Diophantine equation. After all, using just "there exists" statements can't let us talk about "for all $k$"... right?<br/><br/>

        Well, it turns out it's possible... kind of.<br/><br/>

        <h3>Bounded quantifiers</h3>

        There's a weaker version of quantifiers, where the quantified variable is being bounded. They're denoted as $(\forall k)_{\le N}$, which means, instead of the statement needing to be true for <i>all</i> $k\in N$, it only needs to be true under a certain bound $m$.<br/><br/>

        Using bounded quantifiers, the statement "$n$ is squarefree" can be written as
        $$(\forall k)_{\le n}\,[n\bmod (k+2)^2\ne0]$$
        since we only need to check for divisors under $n$.<br/><br/>

        This is a slight improvement from checking every single $k\in\mathbb N$, since now there's only finitely many cases. It also turns out that,<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>Diophantine sets are closed under bounded quantifiers.</b><br/>

        Let $P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0$ be a Diophantine equation. Then the set
        $$\{n\in\mathbb N\mid (\forall x)_{\le n}(\exists y_1,\ldots,y_k)[P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0]\}$$
        is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        This opens up even more possibilities for Diophantine sets. For example:<br/><br/>

        The set $\{n\in\mathbb N\mid n\text{ does not contain the digit }6\}$ is Diophantine, because we can write it as
        $$(\forall k)_{\le n}\left(\left\lfloor\frac n{10^k}\right\rfloor\bmod10\ne6\right)$$
        This theorem is also what will allow us to prove that "polynomial equations are Turing-complete".<br/><br/>

        The proof of this theorem is pretty complicated, and requires lots of clever tricks, but I'll try my best to explain the motivations behind them.<br/><br/>

        <h3>Chinese Remainder Theorem</h3>

        One of those tricks is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>, which states that for any integers $a_0,\ldots,a_n$, and pairwise coprime moduli $m_0,m_1,\ldots,m_n$, there always exists an integer $x$ such that
        $$\begin{cases}x\equiv a_0\pmod{m_0}\\x\equiv a_1\pmod{m_1}\\\vdots\\x\equiv a_k\pmod{m_k}\end{cases}$$
        How does this help? Well, we can use this to simulate "arbitrarily many equations". For example, suppose we wanted to show that
        $$(\forall k)_{\le n}[P(k,x,y,z)=0]$$
        is Diophantine. To do this, we need to somehow combine the equations
        $$\begin{cases}P(0,x_0,y_0,z_0)=0\\P(1,x_1,y_1,z_1)=0\\\vdots\\P(n,x_n,y_n,z_n)=0\end{cases}$$
        If we can somehow choose suitable moduli $m_0,m_1,\ldots,m_{n}$ that are large enough, and construct integers $k,x,y,z$ such that
        $$\begin{cases}k\equiv0\pmod{m_0}\\k\equiv1\pmod{m_1}\\\vdots\\k\equiv n\pmod{m_n}\end{cases}
        \begin{cases}x\equiv x_0\pmod{m_0}\\x\equiv x_1\pmod{m_1}\\\vdots\\x\equiv x_n\pmod{m_n}\end{cases}
        \begin{cases}y\equiv y_0\pmod{m_0}\\y\equiv y_1\pmod{m_1}\\\vdots\\y\equiv y_n\pmod{m_n}\end{cases}
        \begin{cases}z\equiv z_0\pmod{m_0}\\z\equiv z_1\pmod{m_1}\\\vdots\\z\equiv z_n\pmod{m_n}\end{cases}$$
        In a way, we're just "packaging" arbitrarily many integer solutions $x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots$ into just a single variable $x$. Then, since $P$ is a polynomial, our equations from earlier is just equivalent to checking the same equation for different moduli,
        $$\begin{cases}P(0,x_0,y_0,z_0)\equiv0\pmod{m_1}\\P(1,x_1,y_1,z_1)\equiv0\pmod{m_2}\\\vdots\\P(n,x_n,y_n,z_n)\equiv0\pmod{m_{n}}\end{cases}$$
        All this can just be compressed into a single equation!
        $$P(k,x,y,z)\equiv0\pmod{m_1\cdots m_{n}}$$
        From here, we can see that each of $x_1,\ldots,x_{n}$ exists if and only if $x$ itself exists.<br/><br/>

        And with that, we've managed to simulate the "for all" quantifier as a Diophantine equation. Though, there's still a lot of details we have to fill in, such as exactly what moduli to be used:

        <li>How do we find these pairwise coprime modulo $m_1,\ldots,m_n$?</li>
        <li>How do we ensure that each modulo is "big enough"? That $P(i,x_i,y_i,z_i)$ does not exceed $m_i$? (Otherwise, $P(i,x_i,y_i,z_i)\equiv0\pmod{m_i}$ wouldn't necessarily mean $P(i,x_i,y_i,z_i)=0$ for example)</li>

        </ol>

        For the first one, we can easily obtain a sequence of pairwise coprime modulo using factorials:<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-1"><b>Lemma 2.1.</b>
        Let $N$ be a positive integer, and define $m_i=1+(i+1)\cdot N!$ for all $i=0,\ldots,N$. Then $m_0,\ldots,m_N$ are pairwise coprime.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        For every $0\le i\lt j\le N$,
        \begin{align*}
        \gcd(m_i,m_j) &= \gcd(1+(i+1)\cdot N!,1+(j+1)\cdot N!)\\
        &= \gcd(1+(i+1)\cdot N!,(j-i)\cdot N!)
        \end{align*}
        but $0\lt j-i\le N$, so $(j-i)\cdot N!$ is coprime to $1+(i+1)\cdot N!$. Therefore, $\gcd(m_i,m_j)=1$.</details><br/>

        We already showed that <a href="#factorial">factorial</a> is Diophantine, so this is fine. More importantly, these moduli are in an arithmetic sequence, and it turns out the product of an arithmetic sequence is also Diophantine.<br/><br/>

        For the second one, we can set a "max limit" $M$ for the variables, so that the solution should guarantee that $x_i\le M$ for all $i$. Then, each modulo $m_1,\ldots,m_n$ should be bigger than the max possible value of the expression.<br/><br/>

        For the third one, since we defined $m_0,\ldots,m_n$ to be an arithmetic sequence, there's a very nice way to express $k$. Notice that for any $i$, we have
        $$1+(i+1)\cdot N!\equiv0\pmod{m_i}\quad\implies\quad i\equiv-\frac1{N!}-1\pmod{m_i}$$
        Therefore, we just need to pick $k$ such that
        $$k\equiv-\frac1{N!}-1\pmod{m_1\cdots m_{N}}$$
        And finally, we know that <a href="#arith-seq">product of an arithmetic sequence</a> is Diophantine, so we can construct the product $m_1\cdots m_n$ as a Diophantine expression too.<br/><br/>

        With all the preparations complete, we are ready to prove the theorem.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem"><b>Diophantine sets are closed under bounded quantifiers.</b><br/>

        Let $P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0$ be a Diophantine equation. The set
        $$\{n\in\mathbb N\mid (\forall x)_{\le n}(\exists y_1,\ldots,y_k)[P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0]\}$$
        is Diophantine.</div><br/>

        <details><summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>

        Let $t$ be the sum of absolute values of coefficients in polynomial $P$ when it is fully expanded, and let $d$ be the max degree of any term in polynomial $P$. It's easy to see that if $|x|,|y_1|,\ldots,|y_k|\le M$, then
        $$|P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)|\le t\cdot M^d$$
        Consider the following system of equations
        $$\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
        N&\!\!\!\!=t\cdot M^d+1\\
        m&\!\!\!\!=(1+N!)(1+2N!)\cdots(1+(n+1)N!)\\
        ((x+1)\cdot N!+1)\bmod m&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        y_1(y_1-1)(y_1-2)\cdots(y_1-M)\bmod m&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        y_2(y_2-1)(y_2-2)\cdots(y_2-M)\bmod m&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        &\!\!\!\!\vdots\\
        y_k(y_k-1)(y_k-2)\cdots(y_k-M)\bmod m&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)\bmod m&\!\!\!\!=0\end{array}\right.$$
        where $n$ is the parameter, and all the other variables are unknowns.<br/><br/>

        We know how to write <a href="#factorial">factorials</a> and <a href="#arith-seq">products of arithmetic sequences</a>, so we know this system of equations can easily be written as a Diophantine equation.<br/><br/>

        The system of equations will only have a solution in $n$ if and only if there exists some upper bound $M$, such that for every $i=0,1,\ldots,n$, the equation $P(i,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0$ is satisfied by some $y_1,\ldots,y_k\le M$.<br/><br/>

        Note that this is equivalent to saying: "for every $i=0,1,\ldots,n$, the equation $P(i,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0$ is satisfied by some $y_1,\ldots,y_k\in\mathbb N$," because we could just set $M$ to be maximum value that $y_1,\ldots,y_k$ attains over all $i=0,1,\ldots,n$.<br/><br/>

        To see how the system works, for each $i=0,1,\ldots,n$ let $m_i=1+(i+1)\cdot N!$, and let $p_i$ be any prime divisor of $m_i$. Since $m_i$ is coprime with $N!$, we have $p_i>N$.<br/><br/>

        Consider looking at the mod equations in a smaller mod $p_i$. Since these equations are true for mod $m$, and $p_i$ divides $m$, these mod equations should also hold mod $p_i$ too.
        $$\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
        ((x+1)\cdot N!+1)\bmod p_i&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        y_1(y_1-1)(y_1-2)\cdots(y_1-M)\bmod p_i&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        y_2(y_2-1)(y_2-2)\cdots(y_2-M)\bmod p_i&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        &\!\!\!\!\vdots\\
        y_k(y_k-1)(y_k-2)\cdots(y_k-M)\bmod p_i&\!\!\!\!=0\\
        P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)\bmod p_i&\!\!\!\!=0\end{array}\right.$$
        Notice that the first mod equation, $((x+1)\cdot N!+1)\bmod m_i=0$, is equivalent to saying
        \begin{align*}
        (x+1)\cdot N!+1 &\equiv 0\pmod{1+(i+1)\cdot N!}\\
        (x+1)\cdot (i+1)\cdot N!+(i+1) &\equiv 0\pmod{1+(i+1)\cdot N!}\\
        (x+1)\cdot (-1) +(i+1)&\equiv 0\pmod{1+(i+1)\cdot N!}\\
        x &\equiv i\pmod{1+(i+1)\cdot N!}
        \end{align*}
        Thus $x\equiv i\pmod{m_i}$, and therefore $x\equiv i\pmod{p_i}$.<br/><br/>

        For each of the middle equations, We have
        $$y_j(y_j-1)(y_j-2)\cdots(y_j-M)\equiv0\pmod{p_i}$$
        Since $p_i$ is prime, this equation only holds if and only if $y_j\bmod{p_i}\in\{0,1,\ldots,M\}$.<br/><br/>

        Let $y_j^{(i)}$ denote the remainder when $y_j$ is divided by $p_i$. By looking at the final equation mod $p_i$, we see that it's equivalent to saying
        $$P(i,y_1^{(i)},\ldots,y_k^{(i)})\equiv0\pmod{p_i}$$
        But since $i,y_1^{(i)},\ldots,y_k^{(i)}\le M$, that means $|P(i,y_1^{(i)},\ldots,y_k^{(i)})|\lt N\lt p_i$. The only way this could happen is when
        $$P(i,y_1^{(i)},\ldots,y_k^{(i)})=0$$
        In other words, there exists an integer solution to $P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0$ when $x=i$.<br/><br/>

        Finally, by putting together what we learned from mod $p_i$ for each $i=0,1,\ldots,n$, we discover that: the original system of equations can only hold true if for every $i=0,1,\ldots,n$, the equation $P(i,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0$ is satisfied for some integers $y_1,\ldots,y_k\le M$.<br/><br/>

        Conversely, if we know that $P(i,y_1^{(i)},\ldots,y_k^{(i)})=0$ has a solution for every $i=0,1,\ldots,n$, we can just combine the solutions together using Chinese remainder theorem, and combine each $y_j^{(i)}$ into a single variable $y_j$ by doing
        $$\begin{cases}y_j\equiv y_j^{(0)}\pmod{m_0}\\y_j\equiv y_j^{(1)}\pmod{m_1}\\\vdots\\y_j\equiv y_j^{(n)}\pmod{m_n}\end{cases}$$
        which always exists because $m_0,\ldots,m_n$ are pairwise coprime. By substituting this back into the system, we see that it satisfies all the equations.<br/><br/>

        Thus, the system has an integer solution if $P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0$ has a solution for all $x=0,\ldots,n$. This completes the proof that
        $$\{n\in\mathbb N\mid (\forall x)_{\le n}(\exists y_1,\ldots,y_k)[P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_k)=0]\}$$
        is Diophantine.
