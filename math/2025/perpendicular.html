        <h1>Constructions using the Perpendicular Line tool</h1>

        <p class="date">March 1, 2025. 10:10pm</p>

        Using a straightedge and a compass, we construct lots of things in geometry. We can draw midpoints, angle bisectors, circumcircles, regular polygons, and so on. If you're familiar with the game <a href="https://euclidea.fandom.com/wiki/Euclidea_Wiki">Euclidea</a>, there's tons of other examples.<br/><br/>

        One of the most fundamental geometric constructions you can do with a straightedge and compass is drawing perpendicular lines:<br/><br/>

        <div class="problem"><b>Perpendicular Line tool</b><br/>
        Given three noncollinear points $A$, $B$, $C$, draw the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $BC$.</div><br/>

        This "tool" can be simulated with a straightedge and compass using just three steps:<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/intro.png" style="width:22vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Draw a circle with center $B$ passing through $A$.</li>
        <li>Draw a circle with center $C$ passing through $A$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through the intersections of the two circles.</li>
        </ol>

        This new line passes through $A$ and is also perpendicular to $BC$, which is what the tool wanted to construct. I really like how simple this is, the construction does not even require us to draw line $BC$!<br/><br/>

        Now imagine that instead of a straightedge and compass, we only have the <b>Perpendicular Line tool</b> and <i>nothing else</i>. How much can we construct from it? Is it possible to do the usual geometric constructions?<br/><br/>

        <h2>Rules</h2>

        To be precise, here are the only rules:<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/rules.png" style="width:45vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>For any three noncollinear marked points $A$, $B$, $C$, we can mark the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to line $BC$. (This won't draw line $BC$ itself)</li>
        <li>We can mark arbitrary points on the plane.</li>
        <li>We can mark the intersection of any two marked lines.</li>
        </ol>

        Our goal is to uncover how much of the usual geometric constructions we can perform, as well as the limitations of this tool. After all, not everything will be possible!<br/><br/>

        Before you move on with the next section, I highly recommend trying to play around with this construct and see what things you can come up with on your own.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Basic constructions</h2>

        It would be pretty convenient if we could drop the "noncollinear" condition of the Perpendicular Line tool, so the first thing we'll be doing is just that.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-1-1"><b>Lemma 1.1. (Unrestricted Perpendicular Line tool)</b><br/>
        Given any three points $A$, $B$, $C$  (collinear or noncollinear), we can mark the line perpendicular to $A$ passing through line $BC$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-1-1.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Mark any point $P$ not on line $BC$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $P$ and perpendicular to $BC$. Mark any point $Q$ on that line.</li>
        <li>Mark any point $R$ not on line $PQ$ nor $BC$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $R$ and perpendicular to $PQ$. Mark any point $S$ on that line.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $RS$.</li>
        </ol>
        Since $BC\perp PQ\perp RS$, we know $BC$ is parallel to $RS$, so that last step gives the line we wanted to draw.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        The next result gives us the ability to simulate a <b>straightedge</b>. This is very nice, since a straightedge combined with parallel lines is incredibly powerful.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-1-2"><b>Lemma 1.2. (Straightedge)</b><br/>
        Given any two points $A$ and $B$, we can mark line $AB$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-1-2.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Mark any point $P$ not on line $AB$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $P$ and perpendicular to $AB$. Mark any point $Q$ on that line.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $PQ$.</li>
        </ol>
        Since $AB\perp PQ$, drawing that line through $A$ gives us line $AB$ itself.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        The following result gives us access to the <b>Parallel Line tool</b>, which lets us use the straightedge to its full potential.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-1-3"><b>Lemma 1.3. (Parallel Line tool)</b><br/>
        Given any point $A$ and line $BC$, we can mark the line parallel to $BC$ passing through $A$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-1-3.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Mark any point $P$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $P$ and perpendicular to $BC$. Mark any point $Q$ on that line.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $PQ$.</li>
        </ol>
        Since $BC\perp PQ$, the line we just drew is parallel to $BC._\square$<br/><br/>

        Now that we have a straightedge and the Parallel Line tool, we have the following classical result which lets us scale any segment by any rational factor. I unfortunately don't remember where I read it from.<br/><br/>

        Basically, this lets us construct midpoints, divide a segment into $n$ equal parts, or mark reflections.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-1-4"><b>Lemma 1.4. (Midpoint tool)</b><br/>
        Given any two points $A$ and $B$, we can construct the midpoint $M$ of segment $AB$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-1-4.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Draw any line $PQ$ <a href="#lemma-1-3">parallel</a> to line $AB$.</li>
        <li>Draw <a href="#lemma-1-2">lines</a> $AP$ and $BQ$, and mark their intersection $X$.</li>
        <li>Draw lines $AQ$ and $BP$, and mark their intersection $Y$.</li>
        <li>Draw lines $AB$ and $XY$, and mark their intersection $M$.</li>
        </ol>
        In this construction, $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$. The proof is this is very classical and is left as an exercise to the reader. :menherateehee: $_\square$<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-1-5"><b>Lemma 1.5. (Ratio tool)</b><br/>
        Let $r>0$ be any rational number. Given any two points $A$ and $B$, we can construct point $P$ on line $AB$ such that $AP:AB=r$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> Let $r=\frac mn$ for integers $m$ and $n$. Let $2^k$ be any power of 2 greater than $m$ and $n$.<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-1-5.png" style="width:24vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Draw any line $XY$ <a href="#lemma-1-3">parallel</a> to line $AB$.</li>
        <li>Using the <a href="#lemma-1-4">Midpoint tool</a> multiple times, divide segment $XY$ into $2^k$ equal segments. Let $T_1,T_2,\ldots,T_{2^k-1}$ be the dissection points in that order.</li>
        <li>Draw lines $AX$ and $BT_n$, and mark their intersection $Z$.</li>
        <li>Draw lines $AB$ and $ZT_m$, and mark their intersection $P$.</li>
        </ol>
        The constructed point $P$ is what we wanted. This works because $\frac{AP}{AB}=\frac{XT_m}{XT_n}=\frac mn._\square$<br/><br/>

        Setting $r=\frac12$ gives us the midpoint of segment $AB$, while setting $r=2$ gives us the reflection of point $A$ over point $B$.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-1-6"><b>Lemma 1.6. (Reflection over a line)</b><br/>
        Given a point $A$ and line $BC$, we can mark the reflection $A'$ of point $A$ over line $BC$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-1-6.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $BC$. Let this line intersect $BC$ at $P$.</li>
        <li>Using the <a href="#lemma-1-5">Ratio tool</a>, construct the reflection $A'$ of point $A$ over point $P._\square$</li>
        </ol>
        This tool also allows us to reflect lines over other lines, essentially allowing us to double any given angle.<br/><br/>

        <h2>Advanced constructions</h2>

        Here are some of the more "advanced" constructions, now that we have the basic tools set up.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-1"><b>Lemma 2.1. (Triangle centers)</b><br/>
        Given triangle $ABC$, we can construct:
        <ol type="a">
        <li>orthocenter $H$</li>
        <li>centroid $G$</li>
        <li>circumcenter $O$</li>
        <li>nine-point center $N$</li>
        </ol></div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> The orthocenter $H$ is constructed by simply intersecting its altitudes.<br/><br/>

        The centroid $G$ is constructed by intersecting the medians. The medians are drawn by connecting each vertex to the <a href="#lemma-1-4">midpoint</a> of the opposite side.<br/><br/>

        The circumcenter $O$ is constructed by intersecting the perpendicular bisectors. The perpendicular bisectors are drawn by marking the midpoints of each side, then erecting perpendicular lines from them.<br/><br/>

        The nine-point center $N$ is just the midpoint of $OH._\square$<br/><br/>

        You may have noticed I left out the incenter. There's a reason for this, as I'll show later. This next one has to do with circles, despite not being able to draw the circles themselves.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-2"><b>Lemma 2.2. (Tangent line to a circle)</b><br/>
        Given triangle $ABC$, we can construct the line passing through $A$ and tangent to circumcircle $(ABC)$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-2-2.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Mark the <a href="#lemma-2-1">circumcenter</a> $O$ of triangle $ABC$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $AO._\square$</li>
        </ol>

        Although we can't draw the circle itself, we can still draw tangent lines to it, pretending that it exists. As a corollary, we can draw the symmedians of the triangle.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-3"><b>Lemma 2.3. (Symmedian point)</b><br/>
        Given triangle $ABC$, we can construct the symmedian point $K$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-2-3.png" style="width:25vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $B$ and <a href="#lemma-2-2">tangent</a> to circumcircle $(ABC)$. Let this line be $\ell_B$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $C$ and tangent to circumcircle $(ABC)$. Let this line be $\ell_C$.</li>
        <li>Let lines $\ell_B$ and $\ell_C$ intersect at point $K_A$.</li>
        <li>Draw line $AK_A$. This is the $A$-symmedian of triangle $ABC$.</li>
        <li>Similarly, draw the other symmedians $BK_B$ and $CK_C$.</li>
        <li>Lines $AK_A$, $BK_B$, $CK_C$ intersect at the symmedian point $K._\square$</li></ol>

        These next ones give useful constructions involving angles. Please note that all angles specified are oriented, which means the result below also works if we want to subtract angles from one another.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-4"><b>Lemma 2.4. (Angle addition)</b><br/>
        Given points $A,B,X,Y$ such that $\angle ABX=\alpha$ and $\angle ABY=\beta$, we can construct a point $Z$ such that $\angle ABZ=\alpha+\beta$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof Sketch.</b> I don't know of a simpler proof, so please feel free to tell me if you find one.<br/><br/>

        The idea of this proof is to view angles as <i>slopes</i>. Suppose we let $A=(1,0)$ and $B=(0,0)$, and we let lines $AX$ and $AY$ have slopes $x$ and $y$ respectively. Then, it suffices to construct a line with slope $\frac{x+y}{1-xy}$, which can be done by constructing the point $Z=(1-xy,x+y)$.<br/><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-2-4.png" style="width:25vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $AB$. Let this line intersect $BX$ and $BY$ at points $X'$ and $Y'$ respectively.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $X'$ and perpendicular to $BY'$. Let this line intersect $AB$ at point $C$.</li>
        <li>Construct the <a href="#lemma-1-5">reflection</a> $C'$ of point $C$ over $A$.</li>
        <li>Construct the <a href="#lemma-1-4">midpoint</a> $M$ of $X'Y'$.</li>
        <li>Construct the reflection $A'$ of point $A$ over $M$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $C'$ and perpendicular to $AB$. Let this line be $\ell$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A'$ and perpendicular to $X'Y'$. Let this line be $m$.</li>
        <li>The intersection of $\ell$ and $m$ is point $Z$.</li>
        </ol>
        The point $Z$ constructed above satisfies $\angle ABZ=\alpha+\beta$. We will show why this works.<br/><br/>

        Without loss of generality, suppose that $AB=1$, $AX'=x$, and $AY'=y$. It then follows that $x=\tan\alpha$ and $y=\tan\beta$. If we want to prove that $\angle ABZ=\alpha+\beta$, it suffices to show that $\tan\angle ABZ=\frac{x+y}{1-xy}$.<br/><br/>

        In the construction, $X'C\perp BY'$, so that means $\angle AX'C=\angle ABY'=\beta$, giving us $\tan\angle AX'C=y$. Since $AX'=x$, that means $AC=xy$.<br/><br/>

        $C'$ is the reflection of $C$ over $A$, so $AC'=xy$, and therefore $BC'=1-xy$.<br/><br/>

        Next, $M$ is the mipoint of $X'Y'$, so $AM=\frac{x+y}2$. $A'$ is the reflection of $A$ over $M$, giving us $AA'=x+y$.<br/><br/>

        Finally, we see that $AA'ZC'$ is a rectangle, so therefore $\triangle BC'Z$ is a right triangle where $BC'=1-xy$ and $C'Z=x+y$. This proves $\tan\angle ABZ=\tan\angle C'BZ=\frac{x+y}{1-xy}._\square$.
        <br/><br/>

        The ability to add or subtract angles lends us a way to construct isogonal conjugates.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-5"><b>Lemma 2.5. (Isogonal conjugate)</b><br/>
        Given triangle $ABC$ and point $P$, we can construct the isogonal conjugate $P^*$ of point $P$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> Let $AP=\ell$, $BP=m$, $CP=n$. It suffices to show that we can construct the isogonal of $\ell$.<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-2-5.png" style="width:22vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Use the <a href="#lemma-2-4">Angle addition tool</a>, construct a point $Q$ such that $\angle BAQ=2\angle BAC-\angle BAP$.</li>
        <li>Draw line $AQ$. This is the isogonal $\ell'$ of line $\ell$.</li>
        <li>Similarly, draw the other isogonal lines $m'$ and $n'$.</li>
        <li>Lines $\ell'$, $m'$, $n'$ intersect at the isogonal conjugate $P^*$ of point $P._\square$</li>
        </li>
        </ol>

        This gives us an alternative construction for the <a href="#lemma-2-3">symmedian point</a>: It suffices to construct the <a href="#lemma-2-1">centroid</a> of triangle $ABC$, then construct its isogonal conjugate.<br/><br/>

        Although we can freely add angles together, we don't really have any way to divide an angle in half.<br/><br/>

        Another interesting corollary of being able to add angles is performing spiral similarity.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-6"><b>Lemma 2.6. (Spiral similarity)</b><br/>
        Given triangle $ABC$ and segment $XY$, we can construct point $Z$ such that $\triangle ABC\sim\triangle XYZ$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> The main idea is to simply rotate $XY$ by $\angle BAC$ to get line $XZ$, and rotate $XY$ by $\angle ABC$ to get line $YZ$.<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-2-6.png" style="width:28vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $A$ and <a href="#lemma-1-3">parallel</a> to $XY$. Let $Y'$ be any point on this line.</li>
        <li>Using the <a href="#lemma-2-4">Angle addition tool</a>, construct a point $P$ such that $\angle BAP=\angle BAY'+\angle BAC$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $X$ and parallel to $AP$. Let $\ell$ be this line.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $B$ and parallel to $XY$. Let $X'$ be any point on this line.</li>
        <li>Using the Angle addition tool, construct a point $Q$ such that $\angle ABQ=\angle ABX'+\angle ABC$.</li>
        <li>Draw the line passing through $Y$ and parallel to $BQ$. Let $m$ be this line.</li>
        <li>The intersection of lines $m$ and $n$ is point $Z$.</li>
        </ol>
        To see why this works, it might be better to imagine the angles between lines instead of points.<br/><br/>

        We wanted to construct point $Z$ such that $\triangle XYZ$ is essentially a scaled version of $\triangle ABC$ rotated by an angle amount $\angle(AB,XY)$. This is done by constructing lines $XZ$ and $YZ$, which are just lines $AC$ and $BC$ rotated by the same angle amount $\angle(AB,XY)._\square$<br/><br/>

        Spiral similarity is pretty powerful too, since it allows us to perform complex number multiplication and division. In the following construction, we find that it's also possible to locate the center of any spiral similarity.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-2-7"><b>Lemma 2.7. (Spiral similarity center)</b><br/>
        Given two segments $AB$ and $CD$, we can construct point $Z$ such that $\triangle ABZ\sim\triangle CDZ$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof Sketch.</b> My proof of this is pretty contrived, so feel free to tell me if you can find a shorter one.<br/><br/>

        The idea of this proof is to view points as <i>complex numbers</i>. Suppose we let $A=(0,0)$ and $B=(1,0)$, and we let $C=(c_1,c_2)$ and $D=(d_1,d_2)$. Then it's possible to view these points as complex numbers on a plane, $a=0$, $b=1$, $c=c_1+c_2i$, $d=d_1+d_2i$.<br/><br/>

        We wish to construct point $Z$ such that when the plane is centered at $Z$, the segment $AB$ gets sent to $CD$ after multiplying the same complex number. This relationship can be expressed as
        $$\frac{c-z}{a-z}=\frac{d-z}{b-z}\quad\implies\quad z=\frac{ad-bc}{a+d-b-c}$$
        Since $a=0$ and $b=1$, this simplifies to $z=\frac c{c-d+1}$, which makes it easy to construct.<br/><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/lemma-2-7.png" style="width:22vw"></a></center>

        <ol>
        <li>Construct the <a href="#lemma-1-4">midpoint</a> $M$ of $BC$.</li>
        <li>Construct the <a href="#lemma-1-5">reflection</a> $D'$ of point $D$ over $M$.</li>
        <li>Using the <a href="#lemma-2-6">Spiral similarity tool</a>, construct the point $Z$ such that $\triangle AD'B\sim\triangle ACZ$</li>
        </ol>
        The point $Z$ constructed above satisfies $\triangle ABZ\sim\triangle CDZ$. To see why, we'll prove this using complex numbers. It suffices to show that $z=\frac{ad-bc}{a+d-b-c}$.<br/><br/>

        In the construction, $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $m=\frac{b+c}2$.<br/><br/>

        In the next step, $D'$ is the reflection of $D$ over $M$, so $d'=2m-d\implies d'=b+c-d$.<br/><br/>

        Finally, we constructed $Z$ in such a way that $A$ is the center of a spiral similarity sending $D'B$ to $CZ$, giving us an equation
        $$\frac{b-a}{d'-a}=\frac{z-a}{c-a}\quad\implies\quad z=\frac{ad-bc}{a+d-b-c}$$
        This proves $Z$ is the center of the spiral similarity sending $AB$ to $CD._\square$<br/><br/>

        <h2>Impossible constructions</h2>

        We've seen that the Perpendicular Line tool can construct lots of things, which goes to show how powerful it is compared to just a straightedge alone. But even then, it still has lots of limitations.<br/><br/>

        For example, you might have noticed I left out the incenter. There seems to be no way to perform angle bisection with this tool. It also seems as though we can't construct a segment of length $\sqrt2$, or even just constructing a <i>square</i>.<br/><br/>

        Let's move on to some impossible constructions. Here are four of the most important ones,<br/><br/>

        <div class="problem"><b>Angle bisector</b><br/>

        Before we go ahead and prove these, we must first clarify what it means for something to be "impossible to construct". I'll be taking an analytical approach.<br/><br/>

        We say that a geometric construction is possible if there exist a list of instructions that when followed, gives the outcome we want. Each step in the list can only be one of three types:<br/>
        <ol>
        <li>For any three marked points $A$, $B$, $C$, "Mark the line passing through $A$ and perpendicular to $BC$."</li>
        <li>For any two marked lines $\ell$ and $m$, "Mark the intersection of two lines $\ell$ and $m$."</li>
        <li>"Mark a new arbitrary point $P$ on the plane."</li>
        </ol>
        We can formalize this by representing every point $A$ as an ordered pair $(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2$. We can view "marked" points as a subset $S$ of $\mathbb R^2$. Initially, $S$ can be just the empty set, or have some given points to start with. Every step in the construction adds more points into the set $S$.<br/><br/>

        The same is said for lines. We can represent every line $\ell$ as an equation of the form $ax+by=c$, and view "marked" lines as a set $L$. Every step that marks a line means adding this line to the set $L$.<br/><br/>

        The first rule, involving the Perpendicular Line tool, can be formalized as follows:<br/>
        <ol>
        <li>Given three marked points $A=(x_1,y_1)$, $B=(x_2,y_2)$, $C=(x_3,y_3)$, mark the line given by the equation
        $$(x_2-x_3)(x-x_1)+(y_2-y_3)(y-y_1)=0$$
        </ol>
        The second rule about intersecting two lines can be formalized as follows:<br/>
        <ol start=2>
        <li>Given two marked lines $a_1x+b_1y=c_1$ and $a_2x+b_2y=c_2$, mark their intersection point
        $$\left(\frac{b_2c_1-b_1c_2}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1},\frac{a_2c_1-a_1c_2}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1}\right)$$
        </ol>
        The third rule is a bit tricky to explain. Whenever we choose an "arbitrary point", it means our construction must work for <b>every</b> possible placement of that point on the plane, given that it is in "general position". In other words, the "arbitrary point" could be any position as long as it point doesn't lie on any lines it's not supposed to be on. The step itself can be formalized as follows:<br/>
        <ol start=3>
        <li>Introduce two new real variables $x$ and $y$, and mark the point $(x,y)$.</li>
        </ol>
        Whenever this step is used, the final outcome needs to be <i>independent</i> of these two variables. No matter what $x$ and $y$ are, the final construction shouldn't change at all.<br/><br/>

        Now for some tools to prove the impossibility of some constructions. The following theorem formalizes the notion of "we can only construct rational numbers from rational points".<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="theorem-3-1"><b>Theorem 3.1. (Rational points stay rational)</b><br/>
        If we are given marked points $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_k,y_k)$ such that $x_i,y_i$ are rational numbers for all $i$, then
        <ul>
        <li>the only constructible points are of the form $(x,y)$ where $x,y$ are rational numbers,</li>
        <li>the only constructible lines are of the form $ax+by=c$ where $a,b,c$ are rational numbers.</li>
        </ul></div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> This can be proven by induction. Suppose we have a list of instructions that tell us how to construct $(x,y)$. Then we just have to show that after each step, the marked points and lines are always rational too, as stated in the theorem.<br/><br/>

        If at any point during the construction, we have to introduce some new arbitrary point $(x',y')$, the construction needs to work for <i>any</i> values $x,y$ we throw at it. We can assume the worst case scenario: that $x',y'$ are also rational numbers. This way we don't "gain anything new".<br/><br/>

        The only way to mark new lines is using the Perpendicular Line tool. Suppose we have points $A(x_1,y_1)$, $B(x_2,y_2)$, $C(x_3,y_3)$. Then the new line will be
        $$(x_2-x_3)(x-x_1)+(y_2-y_3)(y-y_1)=0$$
        $$(x_2-x_3)x+(y_2-y_3)y=(x_2-x_3)x_1+(y_2-y_3)y_1$$
        Because $x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3$ are all rational numbers, we know that $(x_2-x_3)$, $(y_2-y_3)$, $(x_2-x_3)x_1+(y_2-y_3)y_1$ are also all rational numbers, which proves the theorem for marked lines.<br/><br/>

        The only way to mark new points is by intersecting two lines. Suppose we have two lines $a_1x+b_1y=c_1$ and $a_2x+b_2y=c_2$. Then their intersection point is
        $$\left(\frac{b_2c_1-b_1c_2}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1},\frac{a_2c_1-a_1c_2}{a_1b_2-a_2b_1}\right)$$
        but we know that $a_1,b_1,c_1,a_2,b_2,c_2$ are rational, so it follows this point has rational coordinates too. This completes the theorem's proof.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        The following theorem is similar, but it will be useful for proving some of the trickier stuff. It states that "$\sqrt d$-rational points" is preserved.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="theorem-3-2"><b>Theorem 3.2. ($\sqrt d$-rational points stay $\sqrt d$-rational)</b><br/>
        Let $d>0$ be a nonsquare integer. If we are given marked points $(x_1,y_1\sqrt d),\ldots,(x_k,y_k\sqrt d)$ such that $x_i,y_i$ are rational numbers for all $i$, then
        <ul>
        <li>the only constructible points are of the form $(x,y\sqrt d)$ where $x,y$ are rational numbers,</li>
        <li>the only constructible lines are of the form $ax+b\sqrt d\,y=c$ where $a,b,c$ are rational numbers.</li>
        </ul></div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> Like previously, we just have to show that after each step, marked points are always of the form $(x,y\sqrt d)$ for rationals $x,y$, and marked lines are of the form $ax+b\sqrt d\,y=c$ for rationals $a,b,c$, as stated in the theorem.<br/><br/>

        If at any point during the construction, we have to introduce some new arbitrary point, we can assume the worst case scenario: that it's always of the form $(x',y'\sqrt d)$ where $x',y'$ are rational numbers.<br/><br/>

        The only way to mark new lines is using the Perpendicular Line tool. Suppose we have points $A(x_1,y_1\sqrt d)$, $B(x_2,y_2\sqrt d)$, $C(x_3,y_3\sqrt d)$. Then the new line will be
        $$(x_2-x_3)(x-x_1)+(y_2\sqrt d-y_3\sqrt d)(y-y_1\sqrt d)=0$$
        $$(x_2-x_3)x+(y_2-y_3)\sqrt d\,y=(x_2-x_3)x_1+(y_2-y_3)y_1d$$
        Because $x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3,d$ are all rational numbers, we know that $(x_2-x_3)$, $(y_2-y_3)$, $(x_2-x_3)x_1+(y_2-y_3)y_1d$ are also all rational numbers, which proves all marked lines are indeed of the form $ax+b\sqrt d\,y=c$.<br/><br/>

        The only way to mark new points is by intersecting two lines. Suppose we have two lines $a_1x+b_1\sqrt d\,y=c_1$ and $a_2x+b_2\sqrt d\,y=c_2$. Then their intersection point is
        $$\left(\frac{(b_2\sqrt d)c_1-(b_1\sqrt d)c_2}{a_1(b_2\sqrt d)-a_2(b_2\sqrt d)},\frac{a_2c_1-a_1c_2}{a_1(b_2\sqrt d)-a_2(b_1\sqrt d)}\right)$$
        which simplifies to
        $$\left(\frac{b_2c_1-b_1c_2}{a_1b_2-a_2b_2},\frac{a_2c_1-a_1c_2}{(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)d}\sqrt d\right)$$
        Because $a_1,b_1,c_1,a_2,b_2,c_2,d$ are rational, we know that $\frac{b_2c_1-b_1c_2}{a_1b_2-a_2b_2}$ and $\frac{a_2c_1-a_1c_2}{(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)d}$ are rational too. This proves that the marked point is of the form $(x,y\sqrt d)$, completing the theorem's proof.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        Using these theorems, we can show why some geometric constructions are impossible using just the Perpendicular Line tool. The first one shows that an angle bisector is impossible to construct since it involves "square roots".<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="theorem-3-3"><b>Theorem 3.3. (Angle bisection is impossible)</b><br/>
        It is not possible to construct the angle bisector of any arbitrary angle $\angle ABC$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> Suppose the given points are $A=(1,0)$, $B=(0,0)$, and $C=(1,1)$. Since these points are rational, <a href="#theorem-3-1">the only points and lines we can construct must also be rational</a>.<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/theorem-3-3.png" style="width:22vw"></a></center><br/>

        However, the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ is the line $y=(\sqrt2-1)x$. Since $\sqrt2-1$ is not rational, constructing this line is impossible.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        As a corollary of this, constructing the incenter $I$ of an arbitrary triangle $ABC$ is impossible.<br/><br/>

        This next one is also pretty easy to see, since equilateral triangles are closely related to $\sqrt3$, which also involves a "square root".<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="theorem-3-4"><b>Theorem 3.4. (Constructing an equilateral triangle is impossible)</b><br/>
        It is not possible to construct an equilateral triangle.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> Suppose for the sake of contradiction that it's possible to construct an equilateral triangle $ABC$.<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/theorem-3-4.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center><br/>

        In the worst case scenario, all "arbitrary points" given to us can be rational, so <a href="#theorem-3-1">the only points and lines we can construct must also be rational</a>.<br/><br/>

        Let the slope of line $AB$ be $x$, and the slope of line $AC$ be $y$. Notice that
        $$\tan\angle A=\frac{y-x}{1+xy}$$
        Since $x$ and $y$ are both rational, this shows that $\tan\angle A$ is also rational. But then $\angle A=60^\circ$, so $\tan\angle A=\sqrt3$ must be irrational, contradiction.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        The next one is pretty surprising, since you'd think that a square is possible to construct because of how "perpendicular" it looks. However, we'll soon find out that there's actually no way to construct a square out of just arbitrary points.<br/><br/>

        This proof uses the result that <a href="#theorem-3-2">$\sqrt d$-rational points are preserved</a>.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="theorem-3-5"><b>Theorem 3.5. (Constructing a square is impossible)</b><br/>
        It is not possible to construct a square.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> Suppose for the sake of contradiction that it's possible to construct a square $ABCD$.<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/theorem-3-5.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center><br/>

        In the worst case scenario, the "arbitrary points" given to us could all be of the form $(x,y\sqrt2)$ where $x,y$ are rational numbers. <a href="#theorem-3-2">Theorem 3.2</a> tells us that the only points we can construct must also be of the form $(x',y'\sqrt2)$ for some rationals $x',y'$.<br/><br/>

        Let $A=(x_1,y_1\sqrt2)$ and $B=(x_2,y_2\sqrt2)$ for some rationals $x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2$. For $ABCD$ to be a square, we'd need $D=(x_1-(y_2\sqrt2-y_1\sqrt2),y_1\sqrt2+x_2-x_1)$.<br/><br/>

        But $D$ needs to also be of the form $(x',y'\sqrt2)$ for some rationals $x',y'$. The only way this can happen is when
        $$\begin{cases}y_2\sqrt2-y_1\sqrt2=0\\x_2-x_1=0\end{cases}\implies x_1=x_2~\text{ and }~y_1=y_2$$
        This implies $A$ and $B$ are the exact same point, which is absurd. Therefore, constructing a square has to be impossible.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        Finally, this last one shows that constructing any given fixed angle $\theta$ is impossible. This proof is very similar to a previous proof showing that <a href="#theorem-3-4">constructing an equilateral triangle</a> is impossible.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="theorem-3-6"><b>Theorem 3.6. (Measuring a fixed angle is impossible)</b><br/>
        There does not exist any angle $0^\circ\lt\theta\lt90^\circ$ for which it is possible to construct an angle measuring exactly $\theta$.</div><br/>

        <b>Proof.</b> Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists some $\theta$ for which it is possible to construct an angle $\angle ABC$ measuring exactly $\theta$. Let's consider two different potential worst case scenarios.<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="perpendicular/theorem-3-6.png" style="width:20vw"></a></center><br/>

        In the first worst case scenario, all "arbitrary" points given to us could be rational, so <a href="#theorem-3-1">Theorem 3.1</a> tells us the only points and lines we can construct must also be rational</a>.<br/><br/>

        Let the slope of line $AB$ be $x$, and the slope of line $BC$ be $y$. Notice that
        $$\tan\theta=\tan\angle ABC=\frac{y-x}{1+xy}$$
        Since $x$ and $y$ are both rational, this shows that $\tan\theta$ is also rational.<br/><br/>

        In the second worst case scenario, all "arbitrary" points could all be of the form $(x,y\sqrt2)$ where $x,y$ are rational numbers. <a href="#theorem-3-2">Theorem 3.2</a> tells us the only possible slopes of any line are of the form $k\sqrt2$ for some rational number $k$.<br/><br/>

        This time, let the slope of line $AB$ be $x'\sqrt2$, and the slope of line $BC$ be $y'\sqrt2$. Notice that
        $$\tan\theta=\tan\angle ABC=\frac{y'\sqrt2-x'\sqrt2}{1+(x'\sqrt2)(y'\sqrt2)}=\frac{y'-x'}{1+2x'y'}\sqrt2$$
        Since $x'$ and $y'$ are both rational, $\frac{y'-x'}{1+2x'y'}$ is also rational. This shows that $\tan\theta$ must be of the form $k\sqrt2$ for some rational number $k$.<br/><br/>

        From the two cases, we find that $\tan\theta$ is simultaneously a rational number and also of the form $k\sqrt2$ for some rational $k$. The only way this could happen is when $k=0$, which is a contradiction since $0^\circ\lt\theta\lt90^\circ$.<br/><br/>

        Therefore, it's impossible to construct any angle measuring exactly $\theta._\square$<br/><br/>


        <h2>Characterizing all possible constructions</h2>

        This part might be a bit more technical. In this section, we will characterize <i>all possible constructions</i> you could perform using only the Perpendicular Line tool. It gives you a formula that lets you easily tell you whether a geometric construction is possible or not.<br/><br/>

        In the usual straightedge and compass constructions, it is well-known that a geometric construction can only be done if all their corresponding algebraic expressions "only involves rational numbers and square roots". This is why doubling a cube or squaring a circle impossible, since expressing $\sqrt[3]2$ and $\sqrt\pi$ both require using something beyond just square roots and rationals.<br/><br/>

        A similar analogue exists for the Perpendicular Line tool constructions, but it's a bit complicated to describe.<br/><br/>

        As you saw in the previous section, this tool can only handle geometric constructions whose algebraic expressions "only involves rational numbers". But we also saw that drawing a <i>square</i> is impossible, so that must mean a more restricted condition is at play.<br/><br/>

        <div class="proof"><b>Definition 1. (Field)</b><br/>
        For a real number $r$, let $\mathbb Q(r)$ denote the <b>field</b> obtained by adjoining $r$ to the rational numbers. In other words, $\mathbb Q(r)$ is the set of all numbers of the form $\frac{P(r)}{Q(r)}$ for some polynomials $P,Q$ with rational coefficients.</div><br/>

        Fields are always closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br/><br/>

        For example, $\mathbb Q(\sqrt2)$ is the set of all numbers of the form $p+q\sqrt2$ where $p,q\in\mathbb Q$.<br/><br/>

        I might also adjoin multiple elements to the field: $\mathbb Q(a,b)$ denotes the set of all numbers of the form $\frac{P(a,b)}{Q(a,b)}$ for some (multivariate) polynomials $P,Q$ with rational coefficients..<br/><br/>

        <div class="proof"><b>Definition 2. (Set of points)</b><br/>

        Another way to state <a href="#theorem-3-1">Theorem 3.1</a> is,<br/><br/>

        "If all the given points are of the form $(\mathbb Q,\mathbb Q)$, then
        <ul>

        <li>the only constructible lines are of the form $\mathbb Qx+\mathbb Qy=\mathbb Q$".</li></ul>

        Similarly, another way to state <a href="#theorem-3-2">Theorem 3.2</a> is<br/><br/>

        "If all the given points are of the form $(\mathbb Q,\sqrt d\,\mathbb Q)$, then

        <li>the only constructible lines are of the form $\mathbb Qx+\sqrt d\,\mathbb Qy=\mathbb Q$".</li></ul>

        The following theorem characterizes all possible constructible points and lines if we are given the coordinates axes and a single point along with some coordinate axes.<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="theorem-4-1"><b>Theorem 4.1. (Characterization from one given point)</b><br/>
        Let $\mathbb K$ be the field $\mathbb Q(\frac{b^2}{a^2})$. Given a marked point $(a,b)$ and the coordinate axes,
        <ul>
        <li>a point is constructible if and only if it is of the form $(a\mathbb K,b\mathbb K)$.</li>
        <li>a line is constructible if and only if it is of the form $(b\mathbb K)x+(a\mathbb K)y=ab\mathbb K$</li>
        </ul></div><br/>

        Another way to phrase this theorem without using fields is,<br/><br/>

        "Given a marked point $(a,b)$ and the coordinate axes, a point $(x,y)$ is constructible if and only if $x$ and $y$ can be written as rational functions of $a$ and $b$, such that:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>the "degree" of every term in $x$ and $y$ is 1,</li>
        <li>for every term in $x$, the "degree" of $a$ is odd,</li>
        <li>for every term in $y$, the "degree" of $b$ is odd."</li>
        </ul>

        For example, given a marked point $(a,b)$ and the coordinate axes, the following points are constructible:
        $$\left(\frac{b^2}a,\frac{a^2}b\right),\left(\frac{ab^2}{a^2+b^2},\frac{b^3(a^2+b^2)}{a^4+a^2b^2+b^4}\right)$$
        But the following points are not constructible:
        $$(b,a),(a+b^2,b+a^2),\left(\frac{a^2b^2}{a^3+b^3},\frac{ab}{a+b}\right)$$

        <b>Proof.</b> For the $\impliedby$ direction, we wish to show that if we're given point $(a,b)$ and the coordinate axes, then every point of the form $(a\mathbb K,b\mathbb K)$ is constructible, and every line of the form $(b\mathbb K)x+(a\mathbb K)y=ab\mathbb K$ is constructible.<br/><br/>

        Notice that the field $\mathbb K=\mathbb Q(\frac{a^2}{b^2})$ can be obtained simply having a set with a single element $\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ initially, then inserting all elements that are sums, products, or multiplicative inverses of elements in that set.<br/><br/>

        Thus, to show that every point of the form $(a\mathbb K,b\mathbb K)$ is constructible, it suffices to show:
        <ol type="a">
        <li>Point $(\frac{b^2}a,0)$ is constructible.</li>
        <li>If points $(ak_1,0)$ and $(ak_2,0)$ are constructible, then so is point $(a(k_1+k_2),0)$.</li>
        <li>If points $(ak_1,0)$ and $(ak_2,0)$ are constructible, then so is point $(ak_1k_2,0)$.</li>
        <li>If point $(ak,0)$ is constructible, then so is point $(\frac ak,0)$.</li>
        <li>If points $(ak_1,0)$ and $(ak_2,0)$ are constructible, then so is point $(ak_1,bk_2)$</li>
        </ol>
        Point $(\frac{b^2}a,0)$ can be constructed as follows. Recall that point $(a,b)$ and the coordinate axes were given to us.<br/><br/>

        Thus, using these tools, we have proven that every point of the form $(a\mathbb K,b\mathbb K)$ is constructible.<br/><br/>

        To show that every line of the form $(b\mathbb K)x+(a\mathbb K)y=ab\mathbb K$ is constructible, suppose we wish to construct the line whose equation is $bk_1x+ak_2y=abk_3$ for some $k_1,k_2,k_3\in\mathbb K$.<br/><br/>

        We can just draw the line that passes through $(0,\frac{bk_3}{k_2})$ and $(a,\frac{b(k_3-k_1)}{k_2})$. This points are constructible because $\frac{k_3}{k_2},\frac{k_3-k_1}{k_2}\in\mathbb K$.<br/><br/>

        Therefore, the line $bk_1x+ak_2y=abk_3$ is constructible, which finishes the first half of this proof.<br/><br/>

        The $\implies$ part of the theorem is pretty straightfoward. Just like what we did in Theorems <a href="#theorem-3-1">3.1</a> and <a href="#theorem-3-2">3.2</a>, we just have to show that after each step, marked points are always of the form $(a\mathbb K,b\mathbb K)$ and marked lines are of the form $(b\mathbb K)x+(a\mathbb K)y=ab\mathbb K$.<br/><br/>

        Doing this is pretty straightforward and uninteresting, so I'm omitting this part of the proof. Left as an exercise to the reader. :menherateehee: $_\square$<br/><br/>

        <div class="theorem" id="lemma-4-2"><b>Theorem 4.2. (Characterization from multiple given points)</b><br/>
        Let $\mathbb K$ be the field $\mathbb Q(\frac{b_1^2}{a_1^2},\frac{a_2}{a_1},\frac{a_3}{a_1},\ldots,\frac{a_k}{a_1},\frac{b_2}{b_1},\frac{b_3}{b_1},\ldots,\frac{b_k}{b_1})$. Given a marked points $(a_1,b_1),\ldots,(a_k,b_k)$ and the coordinate axes,
        <ul>
        <li>a point is constructible if and only if it is of the form $(a_1\mathbb K,b_1\mathbb K)$.</li>
        <li>a line is constructible if and only if it is of the form $(b_1\mathbb K)x+(a_1\mathbb K)y=a_1b_1\mathbb K$</li>
        </ul></div><br/>

        Another way to phrase this theorem without fields is,<br/><br/>

        "Given a marked points $(a_1,b_1),\ldots,(a_k,b_k)$ and the coordinate axes, a point $(x,y)$ is constructible if and only if $x$ and $y$ can be written as rational functions of $a_1,\ldots,a_k,b_1,\ldots,b_k$, such that:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>the "degree" of every term in $x$ and $y$ is 1,</li>
        <li>for every term in $x$, the sum of the "degrees" of $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ is odd,</li>
        <li>for every term in $y$, the sum of the "degrees" of $b_1,\ldots,b_k$ is odd."</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Proof.</b> This proof is pretty much almost identical as in <a href="#theorem-4-1">Theorem 4.1</a>. This time, the field is $\mathbb K=\mathbb Q(\frac{b_1^2}{a_1^2},\frac{a_2}{a_1},\ldots,\frac{a_k}{a_1},\frac{b_2}{b_1},\ldots,\frac{b_k}{b_1})$.

        For the $\impliedby$ direction, it suffices to show:
        <ol type="a">
        <li>Points $(\frac{b_1^2}{a_1},0)$, $(a_2,0),\ldots,(a_k,0),(\frac{a_1b_2}{b_1},0),\ldots,(\frac{a_1b_k}{b_1},0)$ are all constructible.</li>
        <li>If points $(a_1k_1,0)$ and $(a_1k_2,0)$ are constructible, then so is point $(a_1(k_1+k_2),0)$.</li>
        <li>If points $(a_1k_1,0)$ and $(a_1k_2,0)$ are constructible, then so is point $(a_1k_1k_2,0)$.</li>
        <li>If point $(a_1k,0)$ is constructible, then so is point $(\frac{a_1}k,0)$.</li>
        <li>If points $(a_1k_1,0)$ and $(a_1k_2,0)$ are constructible, then so is point $(a_1k_1,b_1k_2)$</li>
        </ol>
        All of which are already done in the proof of the previous theorem.<br/><br/>

        The $\implies$ direction is also pretty much the exact same as in Theorems <a href="#theorem-3-1">3.1</a> and <a href="#theorem-3-2">3.2</a>, so they are also left as an exercise.$_\square$<br/><br/>

        Using this, verifying whether a geometric construction is possible is a matter of just expressing it in terms of coordinates.<br/><br/>

        For example, another way we could prove the constructibility of the <a href="#lemma-2-7">spiral similarity center</a> is by expressing the solution in terms of complex numbers,
        $$z=\frac{ad-bc}{a+d-b-c}$$
        then expanding this out using $a=a_1+a_2i$, $b=b_1+b_2i$, $c=c_1+c_2i$, $d=d_1+d_2i$. With some effort, one could see that $z$ is of the form $a_1\mathbb K+a_2\mathbb Ki$, which is constructible!<br/><br/>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        Geometric constructions might be one of my most favorite areas of math. I find it really fun to work with a very limited set of tools and how far you can reach with it! I came up with this idea around two years ago, and decided to pick up this topic again for this blog post.<br/><br/>

        We've seen that the Perpendicular Line tool is surprisingly powerful. It can construct parallel lines, midpoints, add two angles together, and even perform spiral similarity! However, it also comes with some major limitations, such as not being able to construct angle bisectors, or even draw a simple square.<br/><br/>

        The tool is good at measuring ratios between segments, like what an ordinary straightedge would do, but it's also unable to measure the lengths of rotated segments, like what a compass would do. We could say that the Perpendicular Line tool lies somewhere between the straightedge and the compass.<br/><br/>

        Here are a couple other ideas for further exploration: What if instead, we had a tool that can...
        <ol>
        <li>only mark the perpendicular foot from $A$ to $BC$?</li>
        <li>mark the orthocenter of any three points?</li>
        <li>mark the perpendicular bisector of any two points? (for this one, you might find <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/exams/ELMO-2020.pdf">ELMO 2020 P3</a> interesting.)</li>
        </ol>
        That is all. Thank you for reading! (๑&gt;ᴗ&lt;๑)
