        <h1>"The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever" - Part 3</h1>

        <p class="date">April 13, 2024. 5:00pm</p>

        <p>In the parts <a href="logic1.html">one</a> and <a href="logic2.html">two</a>, we developed a system which would let us easily convert any English logic statement into a rigorized mathematical one. It also allowed us to easily handle confusing cases such as anti-paradoxes, and create statements that behave exactly how we want. To put this to the test, let's begin tackling "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever">The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever.</a>" Here it is: (paraphrased to include cats)

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">There are three identical cats in front of you, their names are <i>Maa</i>, <i>Shii</i>, and <i>Rou</i>, but you don't know which is which. Maa always responds truthfully, Shii always lies, and Rou just picks "<i>yes</i>" or "<i>no</i>" at random. You are allowed to ask a single yes-or-no question to a single cat one at a time. Your task is to determine their identities by asking only three questions.</div><br/>

        (Some elements from the original puzzle are omitted here, like the part where they're supposed to say "<i>da</i>" or "<i>ja</i>", but I think it just unnecessarily obfuscates the puzzle.)<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="nyanko.jpg"/></center><br/>

        This puzzle may sound really intimidating, so it helps to break down what is actually <i>going on</i> with this puzzle.<br/><br/>

        First, notice that 3 questions is kinda tight. We only get $2^3=8$ possible responses to distinguish from all $3!=6$ possibilities for the cats' identities. Asking only 2 questions is not enough because then we'll only get $2^2=4$ possible responses. This means every question we ask has to count!<br/><br/>

        Let's say we have some statement $q$ which we wish to know the truth value of. If it is true, we assign it a value $q=0$. If it is false, we assign it a value of $q=1$, just like what we did in the previous parts. Let's define Yes=0 and No=1 too.<br/><br/>

        If we ask Maa the question "Is $q$ true?", she would respond with $q$.<br/>
        If we asked Shii the question "Is $q$ true?", she would respond with the opposite, $\lnot q$.<br/>
        If we asked Rou any question, then her response is random.<br/><br/>

        <h3>Key Observation #1:</h3>

        The first key observation is to realize that we can trick Shii into saying the truth. The response to any question $q$ we make will always be of the form:
        $$\text{response}=\begin{cases}q\oplus c & \text{if we asked Maa or Shii}\\\text{random} & \text{if we asked Rou}\end{cases}$$
        where $c=0$ if the cat we're asking is Maa, and $c=1$ if it's Shii.<br/><br/>

        What if, instead of asking $q$, we try asking $q\oplus c$, to cancel that $c$ term out? We'll ask the question,<br/><br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">"If I asked you whether $q$ is true, what would you respond?"</div><br/>

        to expect a truthful result from Shii. By asking that question, the response from Maa or Shii would be $(q\oplus c)\oplus c=q$,
        \begin{align*}
        \text{response}&=\begin{cases}q & \text{if we asked Maa or Shii}\\\text{random} & \text{if we asked Rou}\end{cases}
        \end{align*}

        We've successfully managed to get Shii to always tell the truth! I guess we've now reduced the puzzle to something slightly simpler:<br/><br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">There are three identical cats in front of you, their names are <i>Maa</i>, <i>Shii</i>, and <i>Rou</i>, but you don't know which is which. <b><u>Maa and Shii both respond truthfully</u></b>, and Rou just picks "<i>yes</i>" or "<i>no</i>" at random. You are allowed to ask a single yes-or-no question to a single cat one at a time. Your task is to determine their identities by asking only three questions.</div><br/>

        <h3>Key Observation #2:</h3>

        We've managed to get two of the cats to always tell the truth. Unfortunately, this doesn't really help with Rou because she always answers randomly.<br/><br/>

        This leads to the second key observation: We need to find <i>any</i> cat who isn't Rou. To do this, we'll need to ask about the identities of the other cats.<br/><br/>

        Let's ask the left cat,<br/><br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">Q1': "Is the middle cat's name Rou?"</div><br/>

        Suppose the answer was "yes", then

        <ol>
        <li><b>If the cat we just asked was not Rou</b>, then we can be sure the right cat is not Rou.</li>
        <li><b>If the cat we just asked was Rou</b>, then the other two cats are not Rou.</li>
        </ol>

        Either way, an answer of "yes" guarantees that the right cat is not Rou. Similarly, an answer of "no" guarantees that the middle cat is not Rou. We've successfully determined a cat who doesn't respond randomly!<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="tree1.png"></center><br/>

        Finally, the rest is straightforward. Since we're sure this cat won't respond randomly, we can freely use the remaining two questions to inquire about the identities of all the cats.<br/><br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">Q2': "Is the left cat's name Rou?"<br/>Q3': "Is your name Maa?"</div><br/>

        Q2 tells where Rou is, and Q3 tells us where Maa and Shii are. That's the entire puzzle cracked!<br/><br/>

        <h3>Putting it all together</h3>

        The three questions we need to ask are:<br/><br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">
        Q1: "If I asked you whether the middle cat's name is Rou, what would you respond?"<br/>
        Q2: "If I asked you whether the left cat's name is Rou, what would you respond?"<br/>
        Q3: "If I asked you whether your name is Maa, what would you respond?"</div><br/>

        The "If I asked ____, what would you respond?" format are there to force Maa and Shii to both give truthful responses.<br/><br/>

        Q1 will be asked to the left cat. Then depending on the answer to Q1, we ask Q2 and Q3 to the non-random cat and deduce the identities of all the cats. Puzzle solved!<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="tree2.png"></center><br/>

        <h2>A "deadly" variation</h2>

        Consider the following variation:<br/><br/>

        <div style="margin-left: 25px">There are three identical cats in front of you, their names are <i>Maa</i>, <i>Shii</i>, and <i>Rou</i>, but you don't know which is which. Maa always responds truthfully, Shii always lies, and Rou just picks "<i>yes</i>" or "<i>no</i>" at random. You are allowed to ask a single yes-or-no question to a single cat one at a time. <u><b>If you ever ask a question that can never be answered by "<i>yes</i>" or "<i>no</i>", all three of them will scratch you to death</b></u>. Your task is to determine their identities by asking only <u><b>two</b></u> questions.</div><br/>

        To clarify, <i>you don't need to survive</i> after deducing their identities. (You'll die a heroic death.)<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="nyankoevil.jpg"/></center><br/>

        This variation is <b><i>much harder</i></b> than the puzzle we just did. This time, you get two ask only <b>two</b> yes-or-no questions! Use them wisely.<br/><br/>

        If you want to try out this puzzle yourself, now might be a good chance to do so before proceeding to <a href="logic4.html">Part 4</a>.<br/>
        Here's a hint: In this variant, its important to know that "yes" and "no" aren't the only possible responses you get when asking a question. You must use that to your advantage!<br/><br/>
