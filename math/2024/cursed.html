        <h1>Cursed Math Problems</h1>

        <p class="date">Created: November 24, 2024. 6:40pm<br/>Updated: November 25, 2024. 11:00am</p>

        Here is a list of unintuitive and (objectively?) cursed results in math. I tried to sort by least cursed to most cursed.<br/><br/>


        <h2>ALGEBRA / ANALYSIS</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers that do not contain the string 314159 in its decimal representation. Does $\displaystyle\sum_{n\in S}\frac1n$ converge?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        Yes. It converges to 2302582.33386...<br/><br/>

        This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempner_series">Kempner series.</a></details>



        <li>Find all functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ atisfying $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ for all $x,y\in\mathbb R$.

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        $f(x)=cx$ is not the only solution to this functional equation. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy's_functional_equation">Cauchy's functional equation</a>.</details>



        <li>Does there exist a function $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that
        <ol type="a">
        <li> $f$ is continuous, but differentiable nowhere?
        <li> $f$ is differentiable, but $f'$ is not continuous?
        <li> $f$ is continuous at a single point, but discontinuous everywhere else?
        <li> $f$ is continuous only at irrational numbers, and discontinuous at everywhere else?
        <li> $f$ is continuous only at rational numbers, and discontinuous at everywhere else?
        </ol>

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        <ol type="a">
        <li> Yes. One example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function">Weierstrass function</a>
        <li> Yes. For example, define $f(x)=\begin{cases}x^2\sin(1/x) & (x\ne0) \\ 0 & (x=0)\end{cases}$. It's derivative $f'$ is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux%27s_theorem_(analysis)">Darboux function</a>.
        <li> Yes. For example, consider $x$ times the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_function">Dirichet function</a>: $f(x)=\begin{cases}x & (x\in\mathbb Q)\\0 & (x\not\in\mathbb Q)\end{cases}$
        <li> Yes. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function">Thomae's function</a>: $f(x)=\begin{cases}\frac1q & \text{if }x=\frac pq\text{ for some coprime integers }p,q\\ 0 & \text{ if }x\text{ is irrational}\end{cases}$
        <li> No. See proof <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-function-which-is-continuous-at-all-rational-points-and-is-discontinuous-at-all-irrational-points">here</a>.
        </ol>

        More cursed analysis stuff can be seen in this book: <i><a href="https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/_olmsted_1.pdf">Counterexamples in Analysis</a></i></details>



        <li>It can be shown that
        \begin{align*}
        &\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\,dx=\frac\pi2\\
        &\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\cdot\frac{\sin(x/3)}{x/3}\,dx=\frac\pi2\\
        &\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\cdot\frac{\sin(x/3)}{x/3}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/5)}{x/5}\,dx=\frac\pi2\\
        &\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\cdot\frac{\sin(x/3)}{x/3}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/5)}{x/5}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/7)}{x/7}\,dx=\frac\pi2\\
        &\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\cdot\frac{\sin(x/3)}{x/3}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/5)}{x/5}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/7)}{x/7}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/9)}{x/9}\,dx=\frac\pi2\\
        &\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\cdot\frac{\sin(x/3)}{x/3}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/5)}{x/5}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/7)}{x/7}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/9)}{x/9}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/11)}{x/11}\,dx=\frac\pi2\\
        &\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\cdot\frac{\sin(x/3)}{x/3}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/5)}{x/5}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/7)}{x/7}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/9)}{x/9}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/11)}{x/11}\frac{\sin(x/13)}{x/13}\,dx=\frac\pi2\\
        \end{align*}
        What is the value of $\displaystyle\int^\infty_0\frac{\sin(x)}x\cdot\frac{\sin(x/3)}{x/3}\cdot\frac{\sin(x/5)}{x/5}\cdots\frac{\sin(x/15)}{x/15}\,dx$ ?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        The answer is $\dfrac{467807924713440738696537864469}{935615849440640907310521750000}\pi$.<br/><br/>

        This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein_integral">Borwein integral</a>.<br/> 3Blue1Brown has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=851U557j6HE">great video</a> explaining this weird phenomenon.</details>


        </ol><br/>

        <h2>GEOMETRY</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>What is the expected distance between two randomly chosen points inside a unit square?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        $\dfrac{2+\sqrt2+5\ln(1+\sqrt2)}{15}$<br/>

        This problem is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_line_segment_length">Mean line segment length</a>. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4VqXRRXi68">here</a> for a solution.</details>

        <li>Is it possible to express $\cos(2\pi/11)$ using radicals?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        Despite there not being a general quintic formula, the answer is Yes.<br/>

        According to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4468729/radical-representation-of-cos-frac-2-pi11">this StackExchange post</a>, the answer, in its full glory, is
        \begin{align*}
        \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{11}\right)=&\frac14\left(\sqrt5-1-i\sqrt{10+2\sqrt5}\right)\cdot\sqrt[5]{-\frac{11}4\left(89-25\sqrt5-5i\sqrt{410+178\sqrt5}\right)}+\\
        &\frac14\left(\sqrt5-1+i\sqrt{10+2\sqrt5}\right)\cdot\sqrt[5]{-\frac{11}4\left(89+25\sqrt5+5i\sqrt{410-178\sqrt5}\right)}+\\
        &\frac14\left(\sqrt5-1-i\sqrt{10+2\sqrt5}\right)\cdot\sqrt[5]{-\frac{11}4\left(89+25\sqrt5-5i\sqrt{410-178\sqrt5}\right)}+\\
        &\frac14\left(\sqrt5-1+i\sqrt{10+2\sqrt5}\right)\cdot\sqrt[5]{-\frac{11}4\left(89-25\sqrt5+5i\sqrt{410+178\sqrt5}\right)}
        \end{align*}
        In fact, it's always possible to write any $\cos(p\pi/q)$ using radicals, but the solution won't be very pretty. The proof involves Galois theory (I think).</details>

        <h2>NUMBER THEORY</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Find all integer solutions to $x^2=2y^4-1$

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        For $x,y\ge0$, the only solutions are $(1,1)$ and $(239,13)$. This equation is called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03011">Ljunggren's equation</a>.
        </details>



        <li>Find all integer solutions to $y^2=x^3+24$

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        For $y\ge0$, the only solutions are $(-2,4)$, $(1,5)$, $(10,32)$, $(8158,736844)$. This equation is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordell_curve">Mordell curve</a>.
        </details>



        <li>Let $O(n)$ be the number of integers $\le n$ with an odd number of prime factors (with multiplicity) and $E(n)$ be the number of integers $\le n$ with an even number of prime factors.<br/>

        The first few $n$ such that $O(n)=E(n)$ are $n=0,2,4,6,10,16,26,40,96,586$. Are there any others?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        Yes. The next smallest is $n=906150256$. This is also known as <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolyaConjecture.html">Pólya Conjecture</a>.<br/>

        A list of all such $n$ found so far can be found on <a href="https://oeis.org/A028488">OEIS</a>.

        <li>Can you find positive integer solutions to
        $$\frac a{b+c}+\frac b{c+a}+\frac c{a+b}=4\,?$$
        <center><img src="fruits.jpg"></center>

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        The smallest solution for $(a,b,c)$ is 80 digits long:
        \begin{align*}
        a &= 154476802108746166441951315019919837485664325669565431700026634898253202035277999\\
        b &= 36875131794129999827197811565225474825492979968971970996283137471637224634055579\\
        c &= 4373612677928697257861252602371390152816537558161613618621437993378423467772036
        \end{align*}
        See <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-positive-integer-solution-for-a-b-and-c-if-c-a-+-b-+-b-a-+-c-+-a-b+c-4">this Quora post</a> or <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c2532359h2760821">this AoPS blog post</a> to see how these could be computed.

        <li>Let $\sigma(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d$ be the sum of divisors function, and $H_n=1+\frac12+\frac13+\cdots+\frac1n$ be the $n^{th}$ harmonic number. Is it true that
        $$\sigma(n)\le H_n+e^{H_n}\log(H_n)$$
        for all integers $n\ge1$?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        It is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. See <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/39944/collection-of-equivalent-forms-of-riemann-hypothesis">here</a> for other equivalent forms.
        </details>



        <li>Is the following inequality true for all integers $n\ge3$?
        $$|\log\mathrm{lcm}(1,2,\ldots,n)-n|<\sqrt n\log^2(n)$$

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        It is also equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. See <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/39944/collection-of-equivalent-forms-of-riemann-hypothesis">here</a> for other equivalent forms.
        </details>



        <li>Does there exist a multivariate polynomial $P(x,y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n)$ with integer coefficients with the following property:<br/>

        For every nonnegative integer $x$, $x$ is a prime number if and only if there exist nonnegative integers $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ such that $P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_n)=0$.

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        Yes. According to <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/MRDP.pdf">this source</a>, one such polynomial is
        \begin{align*}
        &(wz+h+j-q)^2+((gk+2g+k+1)(h+j)+h-z)^2+(16(k+1)^3(k+2)(n+1)^2+1-f^2)^2+(2n+p+q+z-e)^2\\
        &+(e^3(e+2)(a+1)^2+1-o^2)^2+((a^2-1)y^2+1-x^2)^2+(16r^2y^4(a^2-1)+1-u^2)^2+(n+l+v-y)^2+((a^2-1)l^2+1-m^2)^2\\
        &+(ai+k+1-l-i)^2+(((a+u^2(u^2-a))^2-1)(n+4dy)^2+1-(x+cu)^2)^2+(p+l(a-n-1)+b(2an+2a-n^2-2n-2)-m)^2\\
        &+(q+y(a-p-1)+s(2ap+2a-p^2-2p-2)-x)^2+(z+pl(a-p)+t(2ap-p^2-1)-m)^2
        \end{align*}
        Then $k+2$ is prime so long as there are values of the other variables for which the polynomial equal zero.<br/><br/>

        More generally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_set">MRDP theorem</a> states that if $S$ is any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computably_enumerable_set">recursively enumerable set</a> of natural numbers (any set which you can compute with some algorithm), then there exists a polynomial $P(x,y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ such that $x\in S$ if and only if there exist nonnegative integer values for the other variables $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ which make the polynomial 0.

        <h2>COMBINATORICS</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Define sequence $a(n)$ as follows:<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>$a(1)=1$</li>
        <li>$a(n)$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the word $a(1)a(2)a(3)\cdots a(n-1)$ can be written as $xy^k$ for some words $x$ and $y$.</li>
        </ul>
        For example, the sequence begins 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, ...<br/>
        The first time number 4 appears in this sequence is at the 220th term.<br/><br/>

        Does the number 5 ever appear in this sequence? If yes, when does it appear for the first time?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        The earliest index at which number 5 appears in the sequence is approximately
        $$3.271904422329\times 10^{125857689874791897769333}$$
        In fact, every positive integer eventually appears in the sequence, but the first occurrence of any natural $n$ is at approximately $2^{2^{3^{4^{5^{.^{.^{.^{n-1}}}}}}}}$.<br/><br/>

        This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gijswijt's_sequence">Gijswijt's sequence</a>, and is an example of a sequence that grows super-logarithmically.<br/><br/>
        </details>



        <li>Denote the "hereditary base-$n$ notation" of an integer $m$ as writing it in base-$n$, then its exponents in base-$n$, and its exponents' exponents in base-$n$, etc. For example, the hereditary base-3 notation of 100 is
        $$100=3^{3^1+1}+2\cdot3^2+1$$
        Let $m$ be a positive integer. Perform the following step repeatedly until the result is 0, starting with Step 1:<br/><br/>

        "In the $n^{th}$ step, express the current value using base-$(n+1)$ notation. Then replace each occurrence of $(n+1)$ with $(n+2)$, and finally subtract 1 from the resulting new number."<br/><br/>

        If we start with $m=8$, the sequence goes
        \begin{align*}a_1 &= 2^{2^1+1} &&= 8\\
        a_2 &= 2\cdot3^{3^1}+2\cdot3^2+2\cdot3+2 &&= 80\\
        a_3 &= 2\cdot4^{4^1}+2\cdot4^2+2\cdot4+1 &&= 553\\
        a_4 &= 2\cdot5^{5^1}+2\cdot5^2+2\cdot5 &&= 6310\\
        a_5 &= 2\cdot6^{6^1}+2\cdot6^2+6+5 &&= 93395\\
        a_6 &= 2\cdot7^{7^1}+2\cdot7^2+7+4 &&= 1647195\\
        &\vdots
        \end{align*}

        Does this sequence eventually reach 0? If yes, after how many steps?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        Yes. Even though it seems to grow without bound, it will eventually halt after finitely many steps. In fact, this is always true regardless of the starting point $m$. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein's_theorem">Goodstein's theorem</a>, and is an example of a sequence that grows absurdly fast.<br/><br/>

        If we start with $m=8$, then the sequence will eventually reach 0 after more than
        $$A^3(3,3)=A(A(61),A(61))$$
        steps, where $A(m,n)$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann function</a>.
        </details>



        <li>In this problem, we'll refer to "trees" as any rooted tree where each node has a color.<br/><br/>

        We say that a tree T is "contained" in tree T' if T can be formed from T' by deleting edges, vertices, and by contracting edges.<br/><br/>

        We say that a (finite) sequence of trees is "good" if each node of every tree in the sequence is colored in one of $c$ colors, the $i^{th}$ tree in the sequence contains at most $i$ nodes, and a tree cannot contain a tree that appears earlier in the sequence.<br/><br/>

        If only one color can be used for the nodes, the max length of a good sequence is 1.<br/>
        If only two colors can be used for the nodes, the max length of a good sequence is 3.<br/><br/>

        What is the max length of a good sequence, if three colors can be used for the nodes?<br/><br/>

        <center><img src="tree3.webp" height=250></center>

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        The answer is TREE(3), which is absurdly huge! It's <i>extremely</i> bigger than Graham's number, which itself is already unfathomably large.<br/><br/>

        See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P6DWAwwViU">Numberphile's video</a> on TREE(3), or read more about it on the <a href="https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/TREE_sequence">Googology wiki</a>.

        Not entirely sure, but here are my answers:<br/><br/>

        a. $+\infty$<br/>
        b. Does not converge. The expected sum seems to oscillate between 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...<br/>
        c. Does not converge. The expected sum oscillates wildly.<br/>
        d. $\ln2$. This is a bit suspicious since the expected sum is conditionally convergent.<br/><br/>

        This is also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox">St. Petersburg paradox</a>. It shows how absurd expected values can be.

        The answer is independent of ZFC. See <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/1924/what-are-some-reasonable-sounding-statements-that-are-independent-of-zfc">here</a> for some other reasonable-sounding statements that are actually independent of ZFC.</a>

        <li>Define a subset $A$ of $\mathbb R^2$ to be a "cloud around $p$" if every line through $p$ has a finite intersection with $A$. Can three clouds cover the entire plane?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        It is equivalent to the Continuum Hypothesis, which is undecidable in ZFC.

        <li>Can every infinite set be partitioned into two disjoint infinite sets?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        The answer is Yes, but it relies on Axiom of Choice. In ZF (without Choice), there exist models where this statement does not hold. Infinite sets which cannot be partitioned into two disjoint infinite sets are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amorphous_set">amorphous sets</a>.

        <h2>LOGIC / GAME THEORY</h2>



        <ol>
        <li>On an island, there are 100 people who are imprisoned by a mad dictator. All 100 of them have green eyes, and they are also perfect logicians. There is no escape from the island, except for one rule: Every night, any prisoner can approach the guards at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes, they'll be released. If not, they get executed. No one on the island ever knows their own eye color. Each person knows every other person's eye color, there are no reflective surfaces, and they cannot communicate with each other.<br/>
        At some point, an outsider comes to the island, calls together all the people on the island, and makes the following public announcement: "At least one of you has green eyes". What happens next?

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        On the 100th night after the announcement, all the people will leave the island.<br/><br/>

        This is known as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98TQv5IAtY8">green-eyed logic puzzle</a>. To this day I still haven't found a satisfactory explanation to the solution of this riddle. It has to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)">common knowledge</a> somehow.

        <li>Consider infinitely many people each wearing a hat, which is either red or blue. Each person can see the hat color of everyone except themselves. Simultaneously each person guesses the color of their hat. Show that they can form a strategy such that at most finitely many people guess their color incorrectly.

        Mathologer has <a href="https://youtu.be/aDOP0XynAzA?t=150">a video</a> about this riddle. The solution involves the Axiom of Choice.

        <li> There is a house with 100 rooms, and each room contains countably many boxes indexed with the natural numbers. Each box contains a random real number, which is the same over all the rooms (that is, box n contains the same real number in every room).<br/><br/>

        100 set theorists play a game. Each person will go into a unique room and open as many boxes as they like (perhaps countably many) as long as they leave at least one box in their room unopened. Then, each of them need to pick an unopened box in their room, and guess what real number is inside of it.<br/><br/>

        In order to win, 99 of them need to guess correctly.<br/><br/>

        The mathematicians can discuss a strategy beforehand, but after they go into their respective rooms, no more communication is allowed. What is a 100% winning strategy for this seemingly impossible task?

        <h2>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Does the following six-state Turing machine halt? If yes, after how many steps?<br/><br/>

        <center><table style="font-family: Comic Mono">
        <tr><td rowspan=2><b>State</b></td><td colspan=2><b>Symbol</b></td></tr>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>A</td><td>1 R B</td><td>0 L D</td></tr>

        <tr><td>C</td><td>1 L C</td><td>1 L A</td></tr>
        <tr><td>D</td><td>0 L E</td><td>1 R HALT</td></tr>
        <tr><td>E</td><td>1 L F</td><td>0 R B</td></tr>
        <tr><td>F</td><td>0 R C</td><td>0 R E</td></tr>
        </table></center>

        <details><summary>Answer</summary><br/>
        Yes. It halts after this many steps:
        $$\frac{-11+3^{\frac{13+3^{\frac{23+3^{\frac{7+3^{\frac{21+3^{\frac{7+3^{\frac{23+3^{\frac{7+3^{\frac{23+3^{\frac{7+3^{\frac{21+3^{\frac{7+3^{\frac{23+3^{\frac{7+3^{\frac{21+3^{\frac{7+3^{4}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}8}}2>10\uparrow\uparrow15$$
        This number can't even be stored on a comupter!<br/><br/>

        This six-state Turing machine was found by Pavel Kropitz, and it is also the <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/21/bb-6-2-t15.html">current world record</a> for $BB(6)$, where $BB$ is the <a href="https://googology.fandom.com/wiki/Busy_beaver_function">Busy beaver function</a>.
